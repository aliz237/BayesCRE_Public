12833	20228	17369	DYSF	Protein	IL6	mRNA	0	1	15811552	The SJL mouse is a model for human dysferlinopathy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy). We used cDNA microarrays to compare the expression profiles of 10,012 genes in control and SJL quadriceps femoris muscles in order to find genes involved in the degeneration and regeneration process and in dysferlinps functional network. Many genes involved in the process of muscle regeneration are observed to be up-regulated in SJL mice, including cardiac ankyrin repeated protein (CARP), Neuraminidase 2, interleukin-6, insulin-like growth factor-2 and osteopontin. We found the upregulation of S100 calcium binding proteins, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (NEDD4L) with C2 domain, and intracellular protein traffic associated proteins (Rab6 and Rab2). These proteins have the potential to interact with dysferlin. We must reveal some other molecules which may work with dysferlin in order to clarify the pathological network of dysferlinopathy. This process may lead to future improvements in the therapy for human dysferlinopathy.

35227	 5226	 5296	glucocorticoid	Compound	PLAU	mRNA	1	-1	11841347	The two plasminogen activators are mainly different in the structural determinants located in the noncatalytic regions of the proteins that are responsible for the enzyme binding to various components of the cell surface and of the cell environment. Thus, in the noncatalytic N-terminal region of the tPA molecule there are two additional domains as compared to the uPA molecule: a finger-domain and the second kringle-domain, which are responsible for specific binding to fibrin [24].  Precise timing and location of adequate extracellular proteolysis is provided by multiple mechanisms among which the mechanisms regulating the expression of plasminogen activators and of their inhibitors are especially important. A wide spectrum of hormones, growth factors, and cell environment factors are involved in the regulation of expression of the genes of plasminogen activators and of their inhibitors. The expression of uPA is activated by various inflammatory factors: cytokines [25], growth factors [26], and tumor promotors, such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate [27], whereas antiinflammatory agents, such as glucocorticoids, inhibit the expression of uPA [28].

12821	 4302	17369	Adrb Family	Protein	IL6	mRNA	0	1	12665506	This study was aimed to determine whether beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulated by isoproterenol (ISO) activates signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in mouse heart and, if so, to examine the underlying mechanism. We found that treatment of adult male mice by ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) caused a delayed STAT3 activation (at 60-120 min), which was fully abolished by beta-AR antagonist, propranolol. ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in beta-AR-mediated STAT3 activation. In addition, beta-AR stimulation significantly increased gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1). IL-6 protein levels in serum and mouse myocardium were also significantly increased in response to ISO treatment. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, IL-6 level was enhanced significantly after ISO (10-6 mol/liter) stimulation for 2 h and then peaked at 12 h, whereas the response of IL-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant, suggesting that ISO-induced increase in IL-6 is primarily from cardiac fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner in cultured cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody clearly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-AR stimulation leads to a delayed STAT3 activation via an IL-6 family of cytokine-mediated pathway and that cardiac fibroblasts, but not cardiomyocytes, is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.

66329	 4302	19218	Adrb Family	Protein	CTF1	mRNA	0	1	12665506	This study was aimed to determine whether beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulated by isoproterenol (ISO) activates signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in mouse heart and, if so, to examine the underlying mechanism. We found that treatment of adult male mice by ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) caused a delayed STAT3 activation (at 60-120 min), which was fully abolished by beta-AR antagonist, propranolol. ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in beta-AR-mediated STAT3 activation. In addition, beta-AR stimulation significantly increased gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1). IL-6 protein levels in serum and mouse myocardium were also significantly increased in response to ISO treatment. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, IL-6 level was enhanced significantly after ISO (10-6 mol/liter) stimulation for 2 h and then peaked at 12 h, whereas the response of IL-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant, suggesting that ISO-induced increase in IL-6 is primarily from cardiac fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner in cultured cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody clearly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-AR stimulation leads to a delayed STAT3 activation via an IL-6 family of cytokine-mediated pathway and that cardiac fibroblasts, but not cardiomyocytes, is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.

GST-pulldown and immunoprecipitation assay demonstrate that full-length MEF2C protein is able to interact with dHAND in vitro and in vivo, just like MEF2A and bHLH transcription factors MyoD in skeletal muscle cells. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrate that MEF2C and dHAND do not influence each otherps DNA binding activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in H9c2 cells we show that dHAND interact with MEF2C to form protein complex and bind A/T sequence in promoter of ANP.

 5935	18431	 1713	MEF2C	Protein	MYOG	mRNA	0	1	10617583	Myogenin expression, and not MyoD, was found to up-regulate MEF2C expression. MEF2A, -B, and -D expression levels were not up-regulated by overexpression of either MyoD or myogenin. To examine whether MEF2C can differentially regulate MyoD or myogenin expression, P19 cell lines overexpressing MEF2C were analyzed. MEF2C induced myogenesis in P19 cells and up-regulated the expression of myogenin with 25-fold greater efficiency than that of MyoD. Therefore, myogenin and MEF2C participate in a regulatory loop in differentiating stem cells.

65941	18431	 2631	MEF2C	Protein	PPARGC1A	mRNA	0	1	12764228	Although CREB thus seems to be an important factor in the induction of PGC-1-alpha , the increased effect of CaMKIV in combination with CnA suggests that factors in addition to CREB are likely to be involved in the transcription of the PGC-1-alpha gene in muscle. Because MEF2 and NFAT transcription factors are known targets of CaMKIV and CnA in muscle fiber-type determination, we tested the role of these factors in the control of the PGC-1-alpha  promoter. MEF2C, MEF2D, or NFATc3 alone did not have a significant effect on the function of the 2-kb PGC-1-alpha  promoter (Fig. 2A). However, because MEF2 proteins are known to be coactivated by PGC-1-alpha (7), we also tested these factors in cotransfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, a coactivation by PGC-1-alpha  of both MEF2C and MEF2D, but not NFAT, was observed on the PGC-1-alpha  promoter. These data suggest that PGC-1-alpha might participate in the activation of its own promoter and that the MEF2 proteins may function both in the regulation of PGC-1-alpha  expression and as downstream targets of PGC-1-alpha  coactivation of other muscle-selective genes.

Because visceral fat is less sensitive to insulin than subcutaneous fat, even after a meal there is little suppression of lipolysis by the hormone in this fat depot. The resulting direct flux of fatty acids derived from these fat cells through the portal vein to the liver can stimulate glucose production, thus providing a signal for both insulin action and insulin resistance in the liver It [insulin] inhibits the transcription of the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, the rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis66. The hormone also decreases transcription of the genes encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6- phosphatase, and increases transcription of glycolytic enzymes such as glucokinase and pyruvate kinase, and lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

Because visceral fat is less sensitive to insulin than subcutaneous fat, even after a meal there is little suppression of lipolysis by the hormone in this fat depot. The resulting direct flux of fatty acids derived from these fat cells through the portal vein to the liver can stimulate glucose production, thus providing a signal for both insulin action and insulin resistance in the liver It [insulin] inhibits the transcription of the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, the rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis66. The hormone also decreases transcription of the genes encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6- phosphatase, and increases transcription of glycolytic enzymes such as glucokinase and pyruvate kinase, and lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

METHODS: Weri-Rb-1 retinoblastoma cells were cultured in the absence or presence of RA for various periods. DNA microarray analysis profiled gene expression followed by real-time PCR and Northern and immunoblot analyses to confirm the change in expression of selected retinal genes and their gene products. Additional methodology included flow cytometry analysis, immunocytochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS: DNA microarray analysis of approximately 6800 genes revealed RA-induced upregulation of cone-specific genes and downregulation of rod-specific genes in Weri-Rb-1 cells. Other significantly upregulated mRNAs included chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF1), retinoid X receptor (RXR)-gamma, thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-beta2, and guanylyl cyclase-activating protein (GCAP)-1. Real-time PCR and/or Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression changes of a subset of genes including the upregulation of a pineal- and retina-specific transcription factor, CRX. RA treatment also led to G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and increased both the intensity of human cone arrestin (hCAR)-immunoreactivity and the number of apoptotic cells. The cell-cycle-arrest stage correlated with the observed microarray results in which the RA treatment downregulated critical genes such as cyclins (cyclin E, cyclin D3) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK5, CDK10). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that RA induces a subpopulation of retinoblastoma cells to differentiate toward a cone cell lineage while selectively leading other cells into apoptosis.
11296	 2390	 4503	Tretinoin	Compound	GBX2	mRNA	0	1	15722554	Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate embryonic patterning and organogenesis. In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3p member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.

DNA microarray analysis profiled gene expression followed by real-time PCR and Northern and immunoblot analyses to confirm the change in expression of selected retinal genes and their gene products. Additional methodology included flow cytometry analysis, immunocytochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS: DNA microarray analysis of approximately 6800 genes revealed RA-induced upregulation of cone-specific genes and downregulation of rod-specific genes in Weri-Rb-1 cells. Other significantly upregulated mRNAs included chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF1), retinoid X receptor (RXR)-gamma, thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-beta2, and guanylyl cyclase-activating protein (GCAP)-1. Real-time PCR and/or Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression changes of a subset of genes including the upregulation of a pineal- and retina-specific transcription factor, CRX. RA treatment also led to G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and increased both the intensity of human cone arrestin (hCAR)-immunoreactivity and the number of apoptotic cells. The cell-cycle-arrest stage correlated with the observed microarray results in which the RA treatment downregulated critical genes such as cyclins (cyclin E, cyclin D3) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK5, CDK10). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that RA induces a subpopulation of retinoblastoma cells to differentiate toward a cone cell lineage while selectively leading other cells into apoptosis.

43027	 2390	 1749	Tretinoin	Compound	SOX17	mRNA	0	1	15722554	Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate embryonic patterning and organogenesis. In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3p member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.

In this study, we show that this inhibitory effect on alkaline phosphatase activity depends on the stage of cell differentiation; however, expression of tetranectin, which is a recently reported bone matrix protein, was completely inhibited by treatment with retinoic acid, irrespective of the stage of cell differentiation. Similarly, mineral deposit formation in SV-HFO cells was phase-independently inhibited by retinoic acid. To our knowledge, this is the first report that retinoic acid downregulates the tetranectin expression in human osteoblastic cells independent of the stage of cell differentiation, and is correlated with inhibition of mineralization.

We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.

METHODS: Weri-Rb-1 retinoblastoma cells were cultured in the absence or presence of RA for various periods. DNA microarray analysis profiled gene expression followed by real-time PCR and Northern and immunoblot analyses to confirm the change in expression of selected retinal genes and their gene products. Additional methodology included flow cytometry analysis, immunocytochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS: DNA microarray analysis of approximately 6800 genes revealed RA-induced upregulation of cone-specific genes and downregulation of rod-specific genes in Weri-Rb-1 cells. Other significantly upregulated mRNAs included chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF1), retinoid X receptor (RXR)-gamma, thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-beta2, and guanylyl cyclase-activating protein (GCAP)-1. Real-time PCR and/or Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression changes of a subset of genes including the upregulation of a pineal- and retina-specific transcription factor, CRX. RA treatment also led to G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and increased both the intensity of human cone arrestin (hCAR)-immunoreactivity and the number of apoptotic cells. The cell-cycle-arrest stage correlated with the observed microarray results in which the RA treatment downregulated critical genes such as cyclins (cyclin E, cyclin D3) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK5, CDK10). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that RA induces a subpopulation of retinoblastoma cells to differentiate toward a cone cell lineage while selectively leading other cells into apoptosis.

The cell-cycle-arrest stage correlated with the observed microarray results in which the RA treatment downregulated critical genes such as cyclins (cyclin E, cyclin D3) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK5, CDK10). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that RA induces a subpopulation of retinoblastoma cells to differentiate toward a cone cell lineage while selectively leading other cells into apoptosis.

METHODS: Weri-Rb-1 retinoblastoma cells were cultured in the absence or presence of RA for various periods. DNA microarray analysis profiled gene expression followed by real-time PCR and Northern and immunoblot analyses to confirm the change in expression of selected retinal genes and their gene products. Additional methodology included flow cytometry analysis, immunocytochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS: DNA microarray analysis of approximately 6800 genes revealed RA-induced upregulation of cone-specific genes and downregulation of rod-specific genes in Weri-Rb-1 cells. Other significantly upregulated mRNAs included chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF1), retinoid X receptor (RXR)-gamma, thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-beta2, and guanylyl cyclase-activating protein (GCAP)-1.

13496	18654	10470	FOXD3	Protein	NANOG	mRNA	0	1	16790525	we performed cotransfection of Nanog promoter reporter with FoxD3 expression vector in F9 EC cells. As shown in Fig. 2B , FoxD3 activated Nanog promoter in a dose-dependent fashion in F9 cells (Fig. 2B ). To further confirm this finding, we performed the same experiments in ES cells and NIH3T3 cells. As expected, FoxD3 strongly up-regulated the activity of Nanog in ES cells (Fig. 2C ), but surprisingly, had no effect on the same reporter in nonpluripotent NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2D ). These findings suggest that FoxD3 may activate Nanog in a pluripotency-specific manner.  FoxD3 was originally identified as a transcription repressor through binding an AT rich cis-element (20) . To map the cis-elements that FoxD3 utilizes to activate Nanog, a series of deletions were made in Nanog promoter and their activities analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2E , FoxD3 strongly activated reporters bearing –554, –676, and –733 deletions but failed to activate a construct deleting sequences upstream of –269, suggesting that there is a FoxD3 binding site between –269 and –544 in Nanog promoter. Indeed, ChiP analysis confirmed the binding of FoxD3 within this region in vivo in F9 cells (Fig. 2F ). A closer examination of the sequences in the –269 and –554 region identified an AT rich element, which is highly homologous to the identified ES specific enhancer (Fig. 2G, H ). This enhancer was shown as a FoxD3 binding site in vitro (20) . To further investigate this AT element, we inserted three copies of this element upstream of a minimal TK promoter driving a luciferase reporter (Fig. 2H ). When coexpressed with FoxD3, we found that this element is indeed regulated by FoxD3, albeit negatively as reported previously (Fig. 2H ; ref 19 ). Given our finding that FoxD3 activates Nanog expression transcriptionally, we suggest that FoxD3 may assume a dual role in regulating downstream genes, either activation or repression, depending on the context of the target promoter. In the case of Nanog, we showed here that FoxD3 is an activator and, thus, may play an important role in sustaining the expression of Nanog in ES cells.

Sequential deletion mutation analyses reveal three important response elements: Yingyang-1 (YY1; -805/-777), an HIV-1 response element for promoter activation; FoxD3 (-743/-725), a negative regulatory element; and Ets response element (-725/-707), a basal transcriptional activity response element. HIV-1 infection-induced upregulation of YY1 and c-Ets-1 protein, binding to the promoter region as determined by immunoblotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, and induction of YY1 was also observed in virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophages. Silencing of FoxD3 and YY1 in the cell line by small interfering RNA duplexes specific to these molecules significantly up- and downregulated basal OTK18 promoter activity in FoxD3 and YY1 response element-dependent manners, respectively.

Apart from HPV E6 and E7 proteins, cervical cancers frequently express increased levels of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit p110? and ?Np63 as a result of amplification of the q26-29 locus of chromosome 3.

25030	19910	11217	GATA6	Protein	NPPA	mRNA	0	1	16199874	The Hey basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors are downstream effectors of Notch signaling in the cardiovascular system. Mice lacking Hey2 develop cardiac hypertrophy, often associated with congenital heart defects, whereas combined Hey1/Hey2 deficiency leads to severe vascular defects and embryonic lethality around embryonic day E9.5. The molecular basis of these disorders is poorly understood, however, since target genes of Hey transcription factors in the affected tissues remain elusive. To identify genes regulated by Hey factors we have generated a conditional Hey1 knockout mouse. This strain was used to generate paired Hey2- and Hey1/2-deficient embryonic stem cell lines. Comparison of these cell lines by microarray analysis identified GATA4 and GATA6 as differentially expressed genes. Loss of Hey1/2 leads to elevated GATA4/6 and ANF mRNA levels in embryoid bodies, while forced expression of Hey factors strongly represses expression of the GATA4 and GATA6 promoter in various cell lines. In addition, the promoter activity of the GATA4/6 target gene ANF was inhibited by Hey1, Hey2, and HeyL. Protein interaction and mutation analyses suggest that repression is due to direct binding of Hey proteins to GATA4 and GATA6, blocking their transcriptional activity. In Hey2-deficient fetal hearts we observed elevated mRNA levels of ANF and CARP. Expression of ANF and Hey2 is normally restricted to the trabecular and compact myocardial layer, respectively. Intriguingly, loss of Hey2 leads to ectopic ANF expression in the compact layer, suggesting a direct role for Hey2 in limiting ANF expression in this cardiac compartment.

55413	 7687	16991	raloxifene	Compound	PPP1R15A	mRNA	1	1	16079270	The pharmacological preservation of bone in the ovariectomized rat by estrogen, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and bisphosphonates has been well described. However, comprehensive molecular analysis of the effects of these pharmacologically diverse antiresorptive agents on gene expression in bone has not been performed. This study used DNA microarrays to analyze RNA from the proximal femur metaphysis of sham and ovariectomized vehicle-treated rats, and ovariectomized rats treated for 35 days with maximally efficacious doses of 17-alpha ethinyl estradiol, the benzothiophene SERM, raloxifene, the benzopyran SERM, (S)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-2-[4-[2-(1-piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]-2H-1-be ... nzopyran-7-ol (EM652), and the aminobisphosphonate, alendronate. Ovariectomy resulted in 644 significant probe set changes relative to sham control rats (p 765, 652, and 737 probe sets, respectively, relative to ovariectomized control rats. An intersection of these data sets yielded 334 unique genes that were altered after ovariectomy and additionally changed by one or more antiresorptive treatment. Clustering analysis showed that the transcript profile was distinctly different for each pharmaceutical agent and that raloxifene maintained more genes at sham levels than any other treatment. In addition, E2 and alendronate suppressed a cluster of genes associated with bone formation activity below that of sham, whereas raloxifene had little effect on these genes. These data indicate stronger suppressive effects of E2 and alendronate on bone formation activity and that ovariectomy plus raloxifene resembles sham more closely than ovariectomized animals treated with E2, EM652, or alendronate.

20697	10357	 4937	MEIS1	Protein	PBX1	mRNA	0	1	10764806	Mercader et al. (1999) described the role of homeobox genes Meis1, Meis2, and Pbx1 (176310) in the development of mouse, chicken, and Drosophila limbs. Mercader et al. (1999) found that Meis1 and Meis2 expression is restricted to the proximal domain, coincident with the previously reported domain in which Pbx1 is localized to the nucleus. Meis1 regulates Pbx1 activity by promoting nuclear import of the Pbx1 protein. Mercader et al. (1999) also demonstrated that ectopic expression of Meis1 in chicken disrupts distal limb development and induces distal-to-proximal transformations. Mercader et al. (1999) concluded that the restriction of Meis1 to proximal regions of the vertebrate limb is essential to specify cell fates and differentiation patterns along the proximodistal axis of the limb.
23682	10357	 3777	MEIS1	Protein	Hbb-y	mRNA	1	1	18375036	Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if they had a difference in expression level between the two conditions that was at least twofold and the extent of difference in expression was statistically significant (p ! 0.05) in a parametric Welsh-analysis of variance t-test. Only genes that showed concordant results in all three replicates were selected for further evaluation. Genes that differed significantly between wild-type Meis1 and the nonleukemogenic Meis1DHD mutant (lacking its DNAbinding domain) were then identified. With this approach 134 genes (70 increased and 64 decreased, Table 1) could be identified as significantly differentially expressed and linked to the oncogenicity of Meis1.
24309	10357	 7440	MEIS1	Protein	PF4	mRNA	0	1	12609849	Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is expressed during megakaryocytic differentiation. We previously reported that GATA-1 and ETS-1 regulate the rat PF4 promoter and transactivate the PF4 gene. For the present study, we investigated the regulatory elements and their transcription factors responsible for the lineage-specific expression of the PF4 gene. The promoter activities of deletion constructs were evaluated, and a novel regulatory element termed TME (tandem repeat of MEIS1 binding element) (-219 to -182) was defined. Binding proteins to TME were strongly detected in HEL nuclear extracts by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), and they were purified by DNA affinity chromatography. By performing Western blottings and supershift assays, the binding proteins were identified as homeodomain proteins, MEIS1, PBX1B, and PBX2. These factors are expressed in megakaryocytes differentiated from CD34+ cells in human cord blood. MEIS1 and PBXs bind to the TME as MEIS1/PBX complexes and activate the PF4 promoter. In nonmegakaryocytic HepG2 cells, GATA-1 and ETS-1 activate the PF4 promoter approximately 10-fold. Surprisingly, we found that additional expression of both MEIS1 and PBX2 multiplied this major activation another 2-fold. This activation was not observed when MEIS1 binding sites in the TME were disrupted. Furthermore, inhibition of the binding of endogenous MEIS1/PBX complexes to the TME decreased the promoter activity by almost one half, in megakaryocytic HEL cells. Thus, these studies demonstrate that the homeodomain proteins, MEIS1, PBX1B, and PBX2, play an important role in megakaryocytic gene expression.

We have utilized two complementary approaches to identify genes that are predominantly affected by rapamycin in Jurkat T cells. One was to compare levels of polysome-bound and total RNA using oligonucleotide microarrays complementary to 6,300 human genes. Another was to determine protein synthesis levels using two-dimensional PAGE. Analysis of expression changes at the polysome-bound RNA levels showed that translation of most of the expressed genes was partially reduced following rapamycin treatment. However, translation of 136 genes (6% of the expressed genes) was totally inhibited. This group included genes encoding RNA-binding proteins and several proteasome subunit members. Translation of a set of 159 genes (7%) was largely unaffected by rapamycin treatment. These genes included transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, and members of the RAS superfamily. Analysis of [(35)S]methionine-labeled proteins from the same cell populations using two-dimensional PAGE showed that the integrated intensity of 111 of 830 protein spots changed in rapamycin-treated cells by at least 3-fold (70 increased, 41 decreased). We identified 22 affected protein spots representing protein products of 16 genes. The combined microarray and proteomic approach has uncovered novel genes affected by rapamycin that may be involved in its immunosuppressive effect and other genes that are not affected at the level of translation in a context of general inhibition of cap-dependent translation.

The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.

 3190	18115	16645	Akt Family	Protein	CCND1	mRNA	0	1	15572689	To dissect the biochemical mechanism(s) underlying the ability of these protein kinases to promote the cell division cycle, we used Western blotting to assess the effects of RAF and AKT on the expression of a number of proteins known to be targets of RAF or AKT signaling. Of the various immediate- early targets of RAF signaling that we analyzed (e.g., Fos, Jun, c-Myc, and HB-EGF), none showed evidence of cooperative regulation in response to coactivation of AKT and RAF (data not shown) (11, 33, 34). However, we observed cooperative effects of RAF and AKT on the expression of two key cell cycle regulators, cyclin D1 and p27Kip1. Activation of AKT or RAF alone led to a two- or threefold induction of cyclin D1 expression, respectively (Fig. 2A).
34661	18115	 2414	Akt Family	Protein	IKBKG	mRNA	0	1	12566451	It was found that the inhibition of Akt, mediated by K10 expression, leads to impaired NF-kappa B activity.

39562	18115	13744	Akt Family	Protein	CDKN1B	mRNA	-1	-1	15572689	However, coactivation of both signaling pathways led to a sixfold induction of cyclin D1. These observations are consistent with previous reports of cooperative regulation of cyclin D1 by RAS effector pathways and with the reported effects of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway on cyclin D1 gene transcription and of AKT on cyclin D1 protein stabilization (1, 2, 13, 19). Activation of AKT alone had only a modest effect on p27Kip1 expression, consistent with previous observations that suggest that AKT activation reduces p27Kip1 expression by 50% (38). By contrast, activation of RAF alone led to significant repression of p27Kip1 expression, but this was not clearly manifest until 12 to 24 h after RAF activation. Strikingly, coactivation of RAF and AKT led to a rapid and profound repression of p27Kip1 expression that was clearly evident at 6 h and continued up to 24 h (Fig. 2A). It is noteworthy that the effects of RAF activation alone on cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 expression, especially at later time points, are likely enhanced due to activation of PI3p-kinase signaling through the release of autocrine growth factors such as HB-EGF (34, 58). The expression of p27Kip1 is reported to be under both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control (31, 38, 42, 54, 61). To investigate the mechanism(s) underlying the regulated expression of p27Kip1 by RAF and AKT, we assessed the effects of these protein kinases on KIP1 mRNA expression in 3T3-RA cells (Fig. 2B and C).

14532	12703	 8287	Pravastatin	Compound	ATP7A	mRNA	-1	1	16678288	BACKGROUND: Beyond lipid lowering, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) has been found to have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. However, the genetic expression pattern changes in atherosclerotic lesions produced by statin are rarely studied. METHODS: Cholesterol-fed apolipoprotein (Apo) E-deficient mice were examined for the treatment effect of statin on aortic gene expression. ApoE-deficient mice were fed with a hypercholesterolemic diet started at 8 weeks of age for a total of 22 weeks. In the statin treatment group (n=25), the ApoE-deficient mice were treated with pravastatin (80 mg/kg/day) dissolved in water by daily oral inoculation from 25 to 30 weeks of age. For the control group (n=25), the ApoE-deficient mice were orally inoculated with water only for the same period of time. The aortic gene expression affected by pravastatin was identified using oligonucleotide microarray technology with Agilent gene chips. RESULTS: The total cholesterol and atherosclerotic lesion/total aortic area were significantly lower in the pravastatin treatment group. Microarray analysis of the expression of 20,281 murine genes in the aortas between the two groups indicated that 94 genes were significantly regulated. Thirty genes were up-regulated and 64 genes were down-regulated. The most up-regulated genes were troponin T3, actin alpha(1), tubulin alpha(1), regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (Rgs5), stathmin-like 2 and myosin light chain kinase. Most of them are related with cytoskeleton organization, while Rgs5 is a G-protein signal transduction molecule. The most down-regulated genes were adenosine deaminase, atrial natriuretic peptide, troponin T(2), FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3, and glutathione S-transferase alpha(4). CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of the 6-week statin treatment in ApoE-deficient mice is largely dependent on its influence on the cytoskeleton organization. Our study results might provide insight into the clinical benefits of chronic statin treatment.

Deletion of one copy of Sall4 by gene targeting in mouse bone marrow significantly reduced Bmi-1 expression.

17437	 2207	14361	omeprazole	Compound	CXCL12	mRNA	-1	-1	15827235	Potent acid inhibition with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is widely used in clinical medicine, especially for gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPIs cause profound changes in the intragastric environment with near-neutral pH and increase serum concentration of the gastric secretagogue hormone gastrin. Long-term hypergastrinemia increases mucosal thickness and enterochromaffin-like cell density in gastric corpus mucosa and results in development of gastric carcinoids in experimental animals. Our aim was to study responses to potent acid inhibition by characterizing genome-wide gene expression changes in gastric corpus mucosa in rats dosed with the PPI omeprazole. Nine rats received 400 micromol/kg omeprazole daily for 10 wk. Seven rats received vehicle only. Analysis of gastric corpus with microarrays representing 11,848 genes identified 134 genes with changed gene expression levels in omeprazole-dosed rats. Several of the identified genes were previously known to be affected by potent acid inhibition. Of the 62 genes with known functions that changed gene expression levels after PPI dosing, 27 are known to be involved in proliferation and apoptosis and immune, inflammatory, and stress responses. Our study indicates that microarray analysis can detect relevant gene expression changes in the complex gastric tissue, and that cellular processes involved in cell growth and defense responses are strongly affected by PPI dosing. Many genes are identified that were not previously known to be affected by inhibition of gastric acid secretion or that have unknown biological functions. Characterization of the roles of these genes may give new insight into molecular responses to treatment with PPIs.

Together, these and other observations highlight a role for ROS in growth factor signaling and mitogenesis.  2.3.2.2. HBP1 and the p47 phox gene As depicted in Fig. 5, we demonstrate that the transcriptional repressor HBP1 regulates the gene for the p47phox regulatory subunit of the NADPH oxidase. The promoter of the p47phox gene contains six tandem high-affinity HBP1 DNA binding elements at ?1243 to ?1318 bp from the transcriptional start site and which were required for repression. Furthermore, HBP1 repressed the expression of the endogenous p47phox gene through sequence-specific binding.

Our previous studies have shown that the key IFN signaling molecule STAT1 is highly elevated and activated in central nervous system neurons during viral infection and in transgenic mice with astrocyte production of IFN-alpha (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]-IFN-alpha), suggesting that neurons are a very responsive target cell population for IFNs. To elucidate the genomic response of neurons to IFN-alpha, we undertook studies both in vitro and in vivo. Gene chip analysis was applied to RNA from IFN-alpha-treated or untreated primary cortical neuronal cultures derived from embryonic day 15 fetal wild-type or STAT1 knockout (KO) mice. The expression of 51 known and 5 unknown genes was increased significantly by more than twofold after exposure of wild-type but not STAT1 KO neurons to IFN-alpha. Some more highly expressed genes included IFN-induced 15-kDa protein, ubiquitin-specific protease 18, glucocorticoid attenuated response genes, IFN-induced GTPases, and the chemokine CXCL10. For several of these genes, the gene chip findings were confirmed by RNase protection assays. In addition, examination of the expression of some of these selected genes revealed that they were increased in neurons in the brain of either GFAP-IFN-alpha mice or mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. In conclusion, our study revealed a robust STAT1-dependent genomic response of neurons to IFN-alpha, highlighting an innate potential of these cells to defend against viral infection in the brain.

To elucidate the genomic response of neurons to IFN-alpha, we undertook studies both in vitro and in vivo. Gene chip analysis was applied to RNA from IFN-alpha-treated or untreated primary cortical neuronal cultures derived from embryonic day 15 fetal wild-type or STAT1 knockout (KO) mice. The expression of 51 known and 5 unknown genes was increased significantly by more than twofold after exposure of wild-type but not STAT1 KO neurons to IFN-alpha. Some more highly expressed genes included IFN-induced 15-kDa protein, ubiquitin-specific protease 18, glucocorticoid attenuated response genes, IFN-induced GTPases, and the chemokine CXCL10. For several of these genes, the gene chip findings were confirmed by RNase protection assays. In addition, examination of the expression of some of these selected genes revealed that they were increased in neurons in the brain of either GFAP-IFN-alpha mice or mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. In conclusion, our study revealed a robust STAT1-dependent genomic response of neurons to IFN-alpha, highlighting an innate potential of these cells to defend against viral infection in the brain.

Human umbilical veins ECs (HUVECs) were exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10 mM of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for 4 h and to 1 mM SNP or 250 microM of (Z)-1[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NONOate) for 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Also, cells were exposed to DETA-NONOate in the presence and absence of the GC inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10 microM) for 4 h. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, Cy3 and Cy5 labeled, and analyzed using cDNA microarrays. Increasing doses of SNP predominantly depressed gene expression in HUVECs. Gene function was related to growth, adhesion, and cell structure. DETA-NONOate evoked a wave of expression changes (maximum at 4 h), with a remarkable downregulation of the transcription factors MSX1, RELB, and Egr-1. Both SNP- and DETA-NONOate-induced gene expression had faded after 24 h, despite continued elevation of cGMP in the medium. Coadministration of ODQ decreased many, but not all, of the transcriptional responses to DETA-NONOate. NO pronouncedly depressed EC gene expression, in particular of transcription factors. The observation that many, but not all, transcriptional changes induced by NO could be inhibited by inhibition of GC indicates the presence of GC-independent NO actions on gene expression. Thus EC gene expression responds to NO; however, the transcriptional response fades during prolonged exposure. This could allow the EC to respond to increased shear, without vigorous changes in gene expression.

(2001) observed in vivo decreased ICAM-1 expression in a model of arterial injury when HO-1 was up-regulated prior to injury. This model may thus provide a plausible molecular basis for the previously reported anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1.  The HO-2 and HO-3 isoforms probably function normally as first defense against oxidative/inflammatory insults, whereas upon stress HO-1 is swiftly up-regulated and strongly protects against further injurious signals. HO-2, which is highly expressed in brains and testis, protects, e.g., neurons against oxidative stress. HO-2 may function as a physiologic regulator of cellular function, whereas HO-1 plays a role in modulating tissue responses to injury in pathophysiologic states (Wagener et al., 1999).  Adhesion molecule expression can be down-regulated by anti-oxidants and the gaseous mediator NO (De Caterina et al., 1995; Berendji-Grun et al., 2001).

Human umbilical veins ECs (HUVECs) were exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10 mM of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for 4 h and to 1 mM SNP or 250 microM of (Z)-1[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NONOate) for 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Also, cells were exposed to DETA-NONOate in the presence and absence of the GC inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10 microM) for 4 h. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, Cy3 and Cy5 labeled, and analyzed using cDNA microarrays. Increasing doses of SNP predominantly depressed gene expression in HUVECs. Gene function was related to growth, adhesion, and cell structure. DETA-NONOate evoked a wave of expression changes (maximum at 4 h), with a remarkable downregulation of the transcription factors MSX1, RELB, and Egr-1. Both SNP- and DETA-NONOate-induced gene expression had faded after 24 h, despite continued elevation of cGMP in the medium. Coadministration of ODQ decreased many, but not all, of the transcriptional responses to DETA-NONOate. NO pronouncedly depressed EC gene expression, in particular of transcription factors. The observation that many, but not all, transcriptional changes induced by NO could be inhibited by inhibition of GC indicates the presence of GC-independent NO actions on gene expression. Thus EC gene expression responds to NO; however, the transcriptional response fades during prolonged exposure. This could allow the EC to respond to increased shear, without vigorous changes in gene expression.

33114	11936	 4034	NRF1	Protein	E2F6	mRNA	0	1	15257658	To understand how cells control E2F6 expression, we analysed the activity of the previously cloned promoter region of the human E2F6 gene. DNase I footprinting, gel electrophoreticmobility shift, transient transfection and site-directed mutagenesis experiments allowed the identification of two functional NRF-1/alpha-PAL (nuclear respiratory factor-1/alpha-palindrome-binding protein)-binding sites within the human E2F6 core promoter region, which are conserved in the mouse and rat E2F6 promoter region. Moreover, ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analysis demonstrated that overexpressed NRF-1/alpha-PAL is associated in vivo with the E2F6 promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of full-length NRF-1/alpha-PAL enhanced E2F6 promoter activity, whereas expression of its dominant-negative form reduced the promoter activity. Our results indicate that NRF-1/alpha-PAL is implicated in the regulation of basal E2F6 gene expression.

As recent evidence shows that the statins, HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, have beneficial effects on endothelial cell (EC) function independent of lipid-lowering, we explored the hypothesis that statins modulate vascular EC resistance to complement through upregulation of complement-inhibitory proteins. Methods/Results Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin and expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP) and CD59 was measured by flow-cytometry. A dose-dependent increase in DAF expression of upto 4 fold was seen 24-48h post-treatment. CD59 expression was increased by 50% whilst MCP was unchanged. Similar results were obtained with human aortic EC. Statin-induced upregulation of DAF required increased steady-state mRNA and de novo protein synthesis. Inclusion of L-mevalonate, or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, reversed the effect on DAF expression, confirming the role of HMGCoA reductase inhibition and suggesting that DAF expression is negatively regulated by geranylgeranylation. Neither farnesyl pyrophosphate nor squalene inhibited statin-induced DAF expression suggesting the effect is independent of cholesterol lowering. We found that statin-induced DAF expression is mediated by activation of PKC? and inhibition of RhoA and is independent of PI-3K and nitric oxide activity. The increase of DAF following statin treatment is functionally relevant, resulting in marked reduction in C3 deposition and complement-mediated EC lysis inhibitable by anti-DAF mAb 1H4 (p < 0.05). Conclusions These observations provide evidence for a novel cytoprotective action of the statins on vascular endothelium, independent of the effect on lipids, and resulting in enhanced protection against complement-mediated injury. Modulation of complement regulatory protein expression by statins may contribute to the early beneficial effects of statins in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis.

47793	12529	 6938	SPI1	Protein	CTSE	mRNA	-1	1	 9611252	PU.1 and C/EBPalpha are transcription factors essential for normal myeloid development. Loss-of-function mutation of PU.1 leads to an absolute block in monocyte/macrophage development and abnormal granulocytic development while that of C/EBPalpha causes a selective block in neutrophilic differentiation. In order to understand these phenotypes, we studied the role of PU.1 and C/EBPalpha in the regulation of myeloid target genes in vivo . Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNAs encoding receptors for M-CSF, G-CSF and GM-CSF, were expressed at low levels in PU.1(-/-) fetal liver compared with wild type. To identify additional myeloid genes regulated by PU.1 and C/EBPalpha, we performed representational difference analysis (RDA), a PCR-based subtractive hybridization using fetal livers from wild type and PU.1 or C/EBPalpha knockout mice. By introducing a new modification of RDA, that of tissue-specific gene suppression, we could selectively identify a set of differentially expressed genes specific to myeloid cells. Differentially expressed genes included both primary and secondary granule protein genes. In addition, eight novel genes were identified that were upregulated in expression during myeloid differentiation. These methods provide a general strategy for elucidating the genes affected in murine knockout models.

RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, Cy3 and Cy5 labeled, and analyzed using cDNA microarrays. Increasing doses of SNP predominantly depressed gene expression in HUVECs.

Coadministration of ODQ decreased many, but not all, of the transcriptional responses to DETA-NONOate. NO pronouncedly depressed EC gene expression, in particular of transcription factors. The observation that many, but not all, transcriptional changes induced by NO could be inhibited by inhibition of GC indicates the presence of GC-independent NO actions on gene expression. Thus EC gene expression responds to NO; however, the transcriptional response fades during prolonged exposure. This could allow the EC to respond to increased shear, without vigorous changes in gene expression.

(1986) were the first to report the identification of a second form of HO from rat liver microsomes, designated HO-2. Only recently, a third isoform, HO-3, was discovered (McCoubrey et al., 1997). HO-1 and HO-2 share little similarity in amino acid sequence (40%), whereas the HO-2 and HO-3 isoform are far more homologous (90%). All HO isoforms are highly conserved among species in evolution. HO is expressed in virtually all life forms; in prokaryotic bacteria as well as in fungi, plants, and humans, regulating a wide spectrum of cellular processes (Terry et al., 2002). The homology between rat, mouse, and human is for HO-1 and HO-2 proteins higher than 80% and 90%, respectively.  Under normal physiological conditions, most cells express low or undetectable levels of HO-1 protein, whereas HO-2 proteins are constitutively expressed. HO-3 protein expression awaits further characterization. HO-2 transcription is only up-regulated by few agents, such as opiates and adrenal glucocorticoids (Li and David Clark, 2000; Liu et al., 2000).  HO-1 gene expression is highly inducible by more diverse stimuli than any other enzyme described to date (Maines, 1997) and involves a multitude of signaling pathways (Table 2) (Immenschuh and Ramadori, 2000). HO-1 expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level.     View this table: [in this window] [in a new window] TABLE 2 Selection of different inducers of HO-1 gene expression

In mammals, knowledge of the genetic pathways, including the possible direct or indirect targets, regulated by HOX proteins is extremely limited. To identify the downstream genes regulated by posterior HOX proteins, we expressed HOXA13 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking paralog group 13 expression using a bicistronic HOXA13/EGFP retroviral vector. Microarray analysis identified 68 genes with significant, reproducible RNA expression changes (50 activated; 18 repressed) in stable HOXA13-expressing cells. Genes with the GO annotation terms \extracellular matrix\ and \basement membran\ were greatly overrepresented, and several were shown to be regulated by HOX proteins in other studies. Among the genes strongly activated by HOXA13 were Enpp2, a bifunctional enzyme known to modulate tumor and normal cell motility and which is expressed in precartilaginous condensations; Fhl1, a transcription factor implicated in muscle cell differentiation and development; and M32486, a putative integral membrane molecule expressed in the female reproductive tract. Expression differences in the HOXA13-expressing cells were confirmed for selected downstream genes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and in vivo coexpression with Hoxa13 in the limb interdigital mesenchyme was demonstrated for many. For two candidates, Igfbp4 and Fstl, interdigital limb bud expression was reduced in Hoxa13 mutants. To explore whether paralogous and nonparalogous HOX proteins could regulate the same genes, we created new HOX cell lines and examined the expression of selected genes identified by the HOXA13 screen. HOXD13 similarly activatedrepressed 6 tested candidates, demonstrating that multiple downstream genetic pathways may be regulated by paralog HOX proteins. In contrast, HOXA9 was only able to repress expression of some gene targets. A HOXD13 mutant, HOXD13(IQN >)(AAA), incapable of monomeric DNA-binding, activated the expression of 5 HOXA13-upregulated genes; but was incapable of repressing the expression of Ngef and Casp8ap2. Our results suggest that HOX protein-protein interactions without direct HOX DNA-binding may play a larger role in HOX transcriptional regulation than generally assumed, and DNA-binding appears critical for repression.

Expression differences in the HOXA13-expressing cells were confirmed for selected downstream genes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and in vivo coexpression with Hoxa13 in the limb interdigital mesenchyme was demonstrated for many. For two candidates, Igfbp4 and Fstl, interdigital limb bud expression was reduced in Hoxa13 mutants. To explore whether paralogous and nonparalogous HOX proteins could regulate the same genes, we created new HOX cell lines and examined the expression of selected genes identified by the HOXA13 screen. HOXD13 similarly activatedrepressed 6 tested candidates, demonstrating that multiple downstream genetic pathways may be regulated by paralog HOX proteins. In contrast, HOXA9 was only able to repress expression of some gene targets. A HOXD13 mutant, HOXD13(IQN >)(AAA), incapable of monomeric DNA-binding, activated the expression of 5 HOXA13-upregulated genes; but was incapable of repressing the expression of Ngef and Casp8ap2. Our results suggest that HOX protein-protein interactions without direct HOX DNA-binding may play a larger role in HOX transcriptional regulation than generally assumed, and DNA-binding appears critical for repression.

HOXD13 similarly activatedrepressed 6 tested candidates, demonstrating that multiple downstream genetic pathways may be regulated by paralog HOX proteins. In contrast, HOXA9 was only able to repress expression of some gene targets. A HOXD13 mutant, HOXD13(IQN >)(AAA), incapable of monomeric DNA-binding, activated the expression of 5 HOXA13-upregulated genes; but was incapable of repressing the expression of Ngef and Casp8ap2. Our results suggest that HOX protein-protein interactions without direct HOX DNA-binding may play a larger role in HOX transcriptional regulation than generally assumed, and DNA-binding appears critical for repression.

In mammals, knowledge of the genetic pathways, including the possible direct or indirect targets, regulated by HOX proteins is extremely limited. To identify the downstream genes regulated by posterior HOX proteins, we expressed HOXA13 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking paralog group 13 expression using a bicistronic HOXA13/EGFP retroviral vector. Microarray analysis identified 68 genes with significant, reproducible RNA expression changes (50 activated; 18 repressed) in stable HOXA13-expressing cells. Genes with the GO annotation terms \extracellular matrix\ and \basement membran\ were greatly overrepresented, and several were shown to be regulated by HOX proteins in other studies. Among the genes strongly activated by HOXA13 were Enpp2, a bifunctional enzyme known to modulate tumor and normal cell motility and which is expressed in precartilaginous condensations; Fhl1, a transcription factor implicated in muscle cell differentiation and development; and M32486, a putative integral membrane molecule expressed in the female reproductive tract. Expression differences in the HOXA13-expressing cells were confirmed for selected downstream genes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and in vivo coexpression with Hoxa13 in the limb interdigital mesenchyme was demonstrated for many. For two candidates, Igfbp4 and Fstl, interdigital limb bud expression was reduced in Hoxa13 mutants.

HOXD13 similarly activatedrepressed 6 tested candidates, demonstrating that multiple downstream genetic pathways may be regulated by paralog HOX proteins. In contrast, HOXA9 was only able to repress expression of some gene targets. A HOXD13 mutant, HOXD13(IQN >)(AAA), incapable of monomeric DNA-binding, activated the expression of 5 HOXA13-upregulated genes; but was incapable of repressing the expression of Ngef and Casp8ap2. Our results suggest that HOX protein-protein interactions without direct HOX DNA-binding may play a larger role in HOX transcriptional regulation than generally assumed, and DNA-binding appears critical for repression.

In mammals, knowledge of the genetic pathways, including the possible direct or indirect targets, regulated by HOX proteins is extremely limited. To identify the downstream genes regulated by posterior HOX proteins, we expressed HOXA13 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking paralog group 13 expression using a bicistronic HOXA13/EGFP retroviral vector. Microarray analysis identified 68 genes with significant, reproducible RNA expression changes (50 activated; 18 repressed) in stable HOXA13-expressing cells. Genes with the GO annotation terms \extracellular matrix\ and \basement membran\ were greatly overrepresented, and several were shown to be regulated by HOX proteins in other studies. Among the genes strongly activated by HOXA13 were Enpp2, a bifunctional enzyme known to modulate tumor and normal cell motility and which is expressed in precartilaginous condensations; Fhl1, a transcription factor implicated in muscle cell differentiation and development; and M32486, a putative integral membrane molecule expressed in the female reproductive tract.

HOXD13 similarly activatedrepressed 6 tested candidates, demonstrating that multiple downstream genetic pathways may be regulated by paralog HOX proteins. In contrast, HOXA9 was only able to repress expression of some gene targets. A HOXD13 mutant, HOXD13(IQN >)(AAA), incapable of monomeric DNA-binding, activated the expression of 5 HOXA13-upregulated genes; but was incapable of repressing the expression of Ngef and Casp8ap2. Our results suggest that HOX protein-protein interactions without direct HOX DNA-binding may play a larger role in HOX transcriptional regulation than generally assumed, and DNA-binding appears critical for repression.

To identify the downstream genes regulated by posterior HOX proteins, we expressed HOXA13 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking paralog group 13 expression using a bicistronic HOXA13/EGFP retroviral vector. Microarray analysis identified 68 genes with significant, reproducible RNA expression changes (50 activated; 18 repressed) in stable HOXA13-expressing cells. Genes with the GO annotation terms \extracellular matrix\ and \basement membran\ were greatly overrepresented, and several were shown to be regulated by HOX proteins in other studies. Among the genes strongly activated by HOXA13 were Enpp2, a bifunctional enzyme known to modulate tumor and normal cell motility and which is expressed in precartilaginous condensations; Fhl1, a transcription factor implicated in muscle cell differentiation and development; and M32486, a putative integral membrane molecule expressed in the female reproductive tract.

51067	13668	13884	NEUROG3	Protein	CDKN1A	mRNA	1	1	17032746	To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating pancreatic endocrine development and function, pancreatic gene expression was compared between Ngn3-deficient mice and littermate controls on embryonic days 13 and 15. Microarray analysis identified 504 genes with significant differences in expression. Fifty-two of these showed at least twofold reduction in Ngn3 knockouts compared to controls. Many of them were previously described to be involved in endocrine development and function. Among the genes not previously characterized were Rhomboid veinlet-like 4, genes involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis and the Iroquois-type homeobox gene Irx1, the latter was selected for further investigation. In situ hybridisation demonstrated that two Iroquois genes, Irx1 and Irx2, were expressed in pancreatic endoderm of wild-type, but not Ngn3 mutant embryos. Furthermore, ectopic Ngn3 induced prominent Irx2 expression in chicken endoderm. Co-labelling established that Irx1 and Irx2 mRNA is located to glucagon-, but not insulin- or somatostatin-producing cells in mice and chicken. These data suggest that Irx1 and Irx2 serve an evolutionary conserved role in the regulation of alpha-cell-specific gene expression.

This upregulation is due to de novo transcription of receptors. Protein kinase C is involved in the upregulation as Ro-31-8220 attenuates the contraction and the mRNA increase.

Liver shows the highest level of glycerol kinase (GK) activity in humans and mice. Absence of genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with GKD indicates the involvement of modifier genes, including other network partners. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of GKD, we performed microarray analysis on liver mRNA from neonatal glycerol kinase (Gyk) knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Unsupervised learning revealed that the overall gene expression profile of the KO mice was different from that of WT. Real-time PCR confirmed the differences for selected genes. Functional gene enrichment analysis was used to find 56 increased and 37 decreased gene functional categories. PathwayAssist analysis identified changes in gene expression levels of genes involved in organic acid metabolism indicating that GK was part of the same metabolic network which correlates well with the patients with GKD having metabolic acidemia during their episodic crises. Network component analysis (NCA) showed that transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF-4alpha) and peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) had increased activity in the Gyk KO mice compared with WT mice, whereas SREBP-2 was less active in the Gyk KO mice. These studies show that Gyk deletion causes alterations in expression of genes in several regulatory networks and is the first time NCA has been used to expand on microarray data from a mouse KO model of a human disease.

To investigate the effects of these drugs on gene expression in breast cancer cells, we treated estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (known as MCF-7aro cells) with testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, two aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole), and an antiestrogen (tamoxifen). We found that testosterone or 17 beta-estradiol induced the proliferation of MCF-7aro cells at a rate six times faster than the untreated cells. In addition, the testosterone-induced proliferation of MCF-7aro cells was effectively suppressed by letrozole, anastrozole, or tamoxifen. Microarray analyses on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were carried out using total RNA isolated from the control and treated cells. At the false discovery rate of 0.05 and a minimum fold-change criteria of 1.5, 104 genes were identified that were up-regulated and 109 genes were identified that were down-regulated by both androgen and estrogen. More than 50% of these hormone-regulated genes were counter-regulated by all three inhibitors and >90% were counter-regulated by at least one of the inhibitors. Comparing the effect of each inhibitor on gene expression, we observed that letrozole and anastrozole are more similar in terms of the genes they affect compared with treatment with tamoxifen. To validate the gene expression profiles identified from microarray analyses, the expression patterns of 13 representative genes were examined by Northern analysis. Finally, the genes identified as statistically significant were classified based on their expression patterns and biological function/pathways. The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the actions of both aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens at the molecular level. We believe that the results of this study serve as the first step in identifying unique expression patterns following drug treatment, and that this will ultimately be useful in customizing patient treatment strategies for hormone-dependent breast cancer.
14003	 9887	  411	estradiol	Compound	PLAG1	mRNA	0	1	15579445	Estrogen has been postulated to be involved in inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation mainly via estrogen receptor (ER), but the detailed mechanism has remained primarily unknown. Therefore, in this study, microarray analysis was used in two types of cultured human VSMCs: one positive for ER alpha, and the other for ER beta, which were treated by estrogens to detect the estrogen-responsive genes. We also used quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to evaluate mRNA levels of selective target gene (TG) in these cells. We further studied whether the TG product was involved in inhibition of proliferation using small interfering RNA (siRNA) of the TG transfection. We subsequently used quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis to evaluate the expression of these gene products in human aorta. E4F1, a possible inducer of cell growth arrest, was markedly increased only in ER alpha-positive VSMCs by estrogens in both microarray and RT-PCR analyses. Blocking of E4F1 using siRNA suppressed estrogenic inhibition of ER alpha-positive VSMC proliferation. E4F1 mRNA was abundant in premenopausal female aorta with mild atherosclerotic changes. E4F1 is therefore considered one of the estrogen-responsive genes involving ER alpha-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and may play an important role in estrogen-related atheroprotection of human aorta.

We sought to define mechanisms of estrogen (E) signaling in a solid breast tumor model using gene expression profiling. ER(+) T47D-Y human breast cancer cells were grown as xenografts in ovariectomized nude mice under four conditions: 1) 17beta-estradiol for 8 wk (E); 2) without E for 8 wk (control); 3) E for 7 wk followed by 1 wk of E withdrawal (Ewd); or 4) E for 8 wk plus tamoxifen for the last week. E-regulated genes were defined as those that differed significantly between control and E and/or between E and Ewd or control and Ewd. These protocols generated 188 in vivo E-regulated genes that showed two major patterns of regulation. Approximately 46% returned to basal states after Ewd (class I genes); 53% did not (class II genes). In addition, more than 70% of class II-regulated genes also failed to reverse in response to tamoxifen. These genes may be interesting for the study of hormone-resistance issues. A subset of in vivo E-regulated genes appears on lists of clinical ER discriminator genes. These may be useful therapeutic targets or markers of E activity. Comparison of in vivo E-regulated genes with those regulated in identical cells in vitro after 6 and 24 h of E treatment demonstrate only 11% overlap. This indicates the extent to which gene expression profiles are uniquely dependent on hormone-treatment times and the cellular microenvironment.

We found that testosterone or 17 beta-estradiol induced the proliferation of MCF-7aro cells at a rate six times faster than the untreated cells. In addition, the testosterone-induced proliferation of MCF-7aro cells was effectively suppressed by letrozole, anastrozole, or tamoxifen. Microarray analyses on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were carried out using total RNA isolated from the control and treated cells. At the false discovery rate of 0.05 and a minimum fold-change criteria of 1.5, 104 genes were identified that were up-regulated and 109 genes were identified that were down-regulated by both androgen and estrogen. More than 50% of these hormone-regulated genes were counter-regulated by all three inhibitors and >90% were counter-regulated by at least one of the inhibitors. Comparing the effect of each inhibitor on gene expression, we observed that letrozole and anastrozole are more similar in terms of the genes they affect compared with treatment with tamoxifen. To validate the gene expression profiles identified from microarray analyses, the expression patterns of 13 representative genes were examined by Northern analysis. Finally, the genes identified as statistically significant were classified based on their expression patterns and biological function/pathways. The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the actions of both aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens at the molecular level. We believe that the results of this study serve as the first step in identifying unique expression patterns following drug treatment, and that this will ultimately be useful in customizing patient treatment strategies for hormone-dependent breast cancer.

In order to understand better the molecular events associated with the activation of the estrogen receptor (ER), we have used microarray technology to determine the transcriptional program and dose-response characteristics of exposure to a potent synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE), during prepubertal development. Changes in patterns of gene expression were determined in the immature uterus and ovaries of Sprague-Dawley rats on postnatal day (PND) 24, 24 h after exposure to EE, at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 micro g EE/kg/day (sc), for four days (dosing from PND 20 to 23). The transcript profiles were compared between treatment groups and controls using oligonucleotide arrays to determine the expression level of approximately 7000 annotated rat genes and over 1740 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Quantification of the number of genes whose expression was modified by the treatment, for each of the various doses of EE tested, showed clear evidence of a dose-dependent treatment effect that follows a monotonic response, concordant with the dose-response pattern of uterine wet-weight gain and luminal epithelial cell height. The number of genes whose expression is affected by EE exposure increases according to dose. At the highest dose tested of EE, we determined that the expression level of over 300 genes was modified significantly (p dose-dependent analysis of the transcript profile revealed a set of 88 genes whose expression is significantly and reproducibly modified (increased or decreased) by EE exposure (p demonstrate that, exposure to a potent estrogenic chemical during prepubertal maturation changes the gene expression profile of estrogen-sensitive tissues. Furthermore, the products of the EE-regulated genes identified in these tissues have a physiological role in different intracellular pathways, information that will be valuable to determine the mechanism of action of estrogens. Moreover, those genes could be used as biomarkers to identify chemicals with estrogenic activity.

Therefore, in this study, microarray analysis was used in two types of cultured human VSMCs: one positive for ER alpha, and the other for ER beta, which were treated by estrogens to detect the estrogen-responsive genes. We also used quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to evaluate mRNA levels of selective target gene (TG) in these cells. We further studied whether the TG product was involved in inhibition of proliferation using small interfering RNA (siRNA) of the TG transfection. We subsequently used quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis to evaluate the expression of these gene products in human aorta. E4F1, a possible inducer of cell growth arrest, was markedly increased only in ER alpha-positive VSMCs by estrogens in both microarray and RT-PCR analyses. Blocking of E4F1 using siRNA suppressed estrogenic inhibition of ER alpha-positive VSMC proliferation. E4F1 mRNA was abundant in premenopausal female aorta with mild atherosclerotic changes. E4F1 is therefore considered one of the estrogen-responsive genes involving ER alpha-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and may play an important role in estrogen-related atheroprotection of human aorta.

Comparing the effect of each inhibitor on gene expression, we observed that letrozole and anastrozole are more similar in terms of the genes they affect compared with treatment with tamoxifen. To validate the gene expression profiles identified from microarray analyses, the expression patterns of 13 representative genes were examined by Northern analysis. Finally, the genes identified as statistically significant were classified based on their expression patterns and biological function/pathways. The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the actions of both aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens at the molecular level. We believe that the results of this study serve as the first step in identifying unique expression patterns following drug treatment, and that this will ultimately be useful in customizing patient treatment strategies for hormone-dependent breast cancer.

E-regulated genes were defined as those that differed significantly between control and E and/or between E and Ewd or control and Ewd. These protocols generated 188 in vivo E-regulated genes that showed two major patterns of regulation. Approximately 46% returned to basal states after Ewd (class I genes); 53% did not (class II genes). In addition, more than 70% of class II-regulated genes also failed to reverse in response to tamoxifen. These genes may be interesting for the study of hormone-resistance issues. A subset of in vivo E-regulated genes appears on lists of clinical ER discriminator genes. These may be useful therapeutic targets or markers of E activity. Comparison of in vivo E-regulated genes with those regulated in identical cells in vitro after 6 and 24 h of E treatment demonstrate only 11% overlap. This indicates the extent to which gene expression profiles are uniquely dependent on hormone-treatment times and the cellular microenvironment.

54950	 9887	10940	estradiol	Compound	HAP1	mRNA	0	1	15579445	Estrogen has been postulated to be involved in inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation mainly via estrogen receptor (ER), but the detailed mechanism has remained primarily unknown. Therefore, in this study, microarray analysis was used in two types of cultured human VSMCs: one positive for ER alpha, and the other for ER beta, which were treated by estrogens to detect the estrogen-responsive genes. We also used quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to evaluate mRNA levels of selective target gene (TG) in these cells. We further studied whether the TG product was involved in inhibition of proliferation using small interfering RNA (siRNA) of the TG transfection. We subsequently used quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis to evaluate the expression of these gene products in human aorta. E4F1, a possible inducer of cell growth arrest, was markedly increased only in ER alpha-positive VSMCs by estrogens in both microarray and RT-PCR analyses. Blocking of E4F1 using siRNA suppressed estrogenic inhibition of ER alpha-positive VSMC proliferation. E4F1 mRNA was abundant in premenopausal female aorta with mild atherosclerotic changes. E4F1 is therefore considered one of the estrogen-responsive genes involving ER alpha-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and may play an important role in estrogen-related atheroprotection of human aorta.

In order to understand better the molecular events associated with the activation of the estrogen receptor (ER), we have used microarray technology to determine the transcriptional program and dose-response characteristics of exposure to a potent synthetic estrogen, 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE), during prepubertal development. Changes in patterns of gene expression were determined in the immature uterus and ovaries of Sprague-Dawley rats on postnatal day (PND) 24, 24 h after exposure to EE, at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 micro g EE/kg/day (sc), for four days (dosing from PND 20 to 23). The transcript profiles were compared between treatment groups and controls using oligonucleotide arrays to determine the expression level of approximately 7000 annotated rat genes and over 1740 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Quantification of the number of genes whose expression was modified by the treatment, for each of the various doses of EE tested, showed clear evidence of a dose-dependent treatment effect that follows a monotonic response, concordant with the dose-response pattern of uterine wet-weight gain and luminal epithelial cell height. The number of genes whose expression is affected by EE exposure increases according to dose. At the highest dose tested of EE, we determined that the expression level of over 300 genes was modified significantly (p dose-dependent analysis of the transcript profile revealed a set of 88 genes whose expression is significantly and reproducibly modified (increased or decreased) by EE exposure (p demonstrate that, exposure to a potent estrogenic chemical during prepubertal maturation changes the gene expression profile of estrogen-sensitive tissues. Furthermore, the products of the EE-regulated genes identified in these tissues have a physiological role in different intracellular pathways, information that will be valuable to determine the mechanism of action of estrogens. Moreover, those genes could be used as biomarkers to identify chemicals with estrogenic activity.

The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the actions of both aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens at the molecular level. We believe that the results of this study serve as the first step in identifying unique expression patterns following drug treatment, and that this will ultimately be useful in customizing patient treatment strategies for hormone-dependent breast cancer.

63914	 9887	14839	estradiol	Compound	CDV3	mRNA	0	1	15831674	Antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors are important drugs in the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. To investigate the effects of these drugs on gene expression in breast cancer cells, we treated estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (known as MCF-7aro cells) with testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, two aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole), and an antiestrogen (tamoxifen). We found that testosterone or 17 beta-estradiol induced the proliferation of MCF-7aro cells at a rate six times faster than the untreated cells. In addition, the testosterone-induced proliferation of MCF-7aro cells was effectively suppressed by letrozole, anastrozole, or tamoxifen. Microarray analyses on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were carried out using total RNA isolated from the control and treated cells. At the false discovery rate of 0.05 and a minimum fold-change criteria of 1.5, 104 genes were identified that were up-regulated and 109 genes were identified that were down-regulated by both androgen and estrogen. More than 50% of these hormone-regulated genes were counter-regulated by all three inhibitors and >90% were counter-regulated by at least one of the inhibitors. Comparing the effect of each inhibitor on gene expression, we observed that letrozole and anastrozole are more similar in terms of the genes they affect compared with treatment with tamoxifen. To validate the gene expression profiles identified from microarray analyses, the expression patterns of 13 representative genes were examined by Northern analysis. Finally, the genes identified as statistically significant were classified based on their expression patterns and biological function/pathways. The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the actions of both aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens at the molecular level. We believe that the results of this study serve as the first step in identifying unique expression patterns following drug treatment, and that this will ultimately be useful in customizing patient treatment strategies for hormone-dependent breast cancer.

 9561	 9887	 7602	estradiol	Compound	CAP2	mRNA	0	1	16239301	In breast cancers, estrogen receptor (ER) levels are highly correlated with response to endocrine therapies. We sought to define mechanisms of estrogen (E) signaling in a solid breast tumor model using gene expression profiling. ER(+) T47D-Y human breast cancer cells were grown as xenografts in ovariectomized nude mice under four conditions: 1) 17beta-estradiol for 8 wk (E); 2) without E for 8 wk (control); 3) E for 7 wk followed by 1 wk of E withdrawal (Ewd); or 4) E for 8 wk plus tamoxifen for the last week. E-regulated genes were defined as those that differed significantly between control and E and/or between E and Ewd or control and Ewd. These protocols generated 188 in vivo E-regulated genes that showed two major patterns of regulation. Approximately 46% returned to basal states after Ewd (class I genes); 53% did not (class II genes). In addition, more than 70% of class II-regulated genes also failed to reverse in response to tamoxifen. These genes may be interesting for the study of hormone-resistance issues. A subset of in vivo E-regulated genes appears on lists of clinical ER discriminator genes. These may be useful therapeutic targets or markers of E activity. Comparison of in vivo E-regulated genes with those regulated in identical cells in vitro after 6 and 24 h of E treatment demonstrate only 11% overlap. This indicates the extent to which gene expression profiles are uniquely dependent on hormone-treatment times and the cellular microenvironment.

MIP-2 binding to CXCR2 induces PMN migration, as well as GRK2 and GRK5 expression, through PI3K-? signaling. Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-?-activated signaling is postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2 internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating the crosstalk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory signals.

In contrast, strong upregulation of DAP kinase protein could be detected after 2 days of agLDL treatment (Figure 3A). DAP kinase expression was associated with enhanced levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53. We also observed a progressive increase in Bax and TNF receptor 2 expression during foam cell formation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that agLDL could significantly induce (3-fold) both DAP kinase and Bax gene transcription (Figure 3B).

In contrast, insulin (12), low density lipoprotein (13), and progesterone (11) up-regulate receptor expression by decreasing AT1AR mRNA decay rates. Additionally, rat AT1AR expression is regulated by translational mechanisms via cytosolic proteins that interact with the 5p-UTR of the receptor mRNA (10, 14–18).

However, when the partially delipidated cells were loaded with LDL for 24 h, the ORP-1 transcript was up-regulated by 2-fold (Fig. 5). Simultaneously, the cellular cholesterol level returned back to normal (not shown). Short-term treatment of the sterol-depleted cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (5 ug/ml of 25-hydroxycholesterol for 4 h), a condition known to stimulate the translocation of OSBP to the Golgi apparatus (10, 13), had a minor (1.5-fold) stimulatory effect on the expression of the ORP-1 mRNA (Fig. 5).
44417	 5652	13271	Low Density LipoProtein	Compound	CCL2	mRNA	0	1	12626661	Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent chemotactic agent for monocytes and other cells and is thought to be involved in atherosclerosis, recruiting monocytes to the subendothelial space or to the site of inflammation. Angiotensin II has been demonstrated, at least in animal models, to stimulate MCP-1 expression. We investigated the effect of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists irbesartan and losartan on MCP-1 production by freshly isolated human monocytes. Irbesartan and losartan inhibited basal MCP-1 production in a dose-dependent manner. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) stimulated MCP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, with 200 microg/ml LDL protein giving a 2-fold increase in MCP-1. Irbesartan and losartan dose dependently blocked LDL-stimulated MCP-1. An angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist, S-(+)-1-([4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl)-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7- ... tetrahydro-1H-imidazo(4,5-c)pyridine-6-carboxylic acid (PD123319), had no significant effect on basal MCP-1 levels or LDL-stimulated MCP-1. After noting homology between the AT1 receptor and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, we showed that irbesartan inhibited both [3H]PAF binding to human monocytes and carbamyl-PAF stimulation of MCP-1. However, irbesartan affinity for the PAF receptor was 700 times less than PAF, suggesting that there may be another mechanism for irbesartan inhibition of PAF-stimulated MCP-1. This is the first report showing that AT1 receptor antagonists inhibit basal as well as LDL- and PAF-stimulated MCP-1 production in freshly isolated human monocytes.
  448	 5652	14844	Low Density LipoProtein	Compound	ACTG1	mRNA	-1	1	16466844	Many studies on atherosclerosis have indicated an association with Chlamydophila pneumoniae, a respiratory intracellular pathogen that can infect bronchoalveolar macrophages, and be transported to sites of vascular injury. Furthermore, the connection between low density lipoprotein (LDL), macrophages, foam cell formation, and atherosclerosis is well established. Five study models were designed to mimic the early events in plaque formation, i.e. untreated U937 human macrophages as control; macrophages treated with LDL only; macrophages infected with the AR-39 strain of C. pneumoniae only; and the last two models in which macrophages were exposed to both C. pneumoniae and LDL but in different order. Differential display RT-PCR was employed to analyze mRNAs from the five models to elucidate the transcriptional responses arising from macrophage interactions with C. pneumoniae and/or LDL. Out of 235 expressed sequence tags, the altered expression patterns of 29 selected genes at various time-points were authenticated by semi-quantitative and real-time RT-PCR. In relation to atherosclerosis, some interesting modified transcripts are involved in cell proliferation (CDC2, CDC27, CDC42EP3, GBDR1, GPR6, RPL27A, Similar to COX2), apoptosis (BCL2A1), ubiquitination (CTSH, HSPC150, NUC2), and structural integrity (ACTG1, FLOT1). Other genes exhibiting altered expression include those that modulate inflammatory and immune responses or signal transduction linking infection to host immunity (ARPP-19, BLAME, HCA58, IK cytokine, IRS2, STAT1P1). The transcriptional alterations of critical human genes in response to C. pneumoniae infection and foam cell development provide insights into certain key molecular pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis.

In this study, we investigated the effects of estrogen (E2) on SOCS-3 expression in T47D and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Real-time PCR analysis of E2-treated T47D cells revealed a ligand and time-dependent increase in of SOCS-3 mRNA levels. Cloning of a 1.7 kb fragment of the human SOCS-3 5p flanking sequence, and subsequent analysis of potential transcription factor-binding sites identified an incomplete ERE motif located -1493 to -1489 upstream of the start site. Transient transfection of the cloned fragment in MCF-7 cells showed that both E2 and genistein treatment caused an increase in reporter gene activity, which was inhibited by co-treatment with ICI 182,780. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed an E2 and time-dependent recruitment of ERalpha to the E2 responsive region of the human SOCS-3 promoter. In summary, this study shows that ERalpha directly regulates human SOCS-3 promoter activity in human breast cancer cells, thus modulating cytokine activity.

At the G1-S transition, hEmi1 is transcriptionally induced by the E2F transcription factor, much like cyclin A. hEmi1 overexpression accelerates S phase entry and can override a G1 block caused by overexpression of Cdh1 or the E2F-inhibitor p105 retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Depleting cells of hEmi1 through RNA interference prevents accumulation of cyclin A and inhibits S phase entry. These data suggest that E2F can activate both transcription of cyclin A and the hEmi1-dependent stabilization of APC(Cdh1) targets, such as cyclin A, to promote S phase entry.

51667	15426	  219	hydrogen peroxide	Compound	FASLG	mRNA	-1	1	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...

Four distinct patterns of gene expression were activated after androgen withdrawal; the vast majority of genes displayed an early or late transient increase in expression levels. A differential ability of rescue was seen among androgen-regulated genes, depending on time of androgen supplementation. Many of the genes that were rescued at 4 d were functionally linked by direct interactions and converged on IGF-I.

17621	 7401	19456	androgen	Compound	LPAR3	mRNA	0	1	12185249	The human prostate gland is an important target organ of androgenic hormones. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone interact with the androgen receptor to regulate vital aspects of prostate growth and function including cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, and secretory activity. Our objective in this study was to characterize the temporal program of transcription that reflects the cellular response to androgens and to identify specific androgen-regulated genes (ARGs) or gene networks that participate in these responses. We used cDNA microarrays representing about 20,000 distinct human genes to profile androgen-responsive transcripts in the LNCaP adenocarcinoma cell line and identified 146 genes with transcript alterations more than 3-fold. Of these, 103 encode proteins with described functional roles, and 43 represent transcripts that have yet to be characterized. Temporal gene expression profiles grouped the ARGs into four distinct cohorts. Five uncharacterized ARGs demonstrated exclusive or high expression levels in the prostate relative to other tissues studied. A search of available DNA sequence upstream of 28 ARGs identified 25 with homology to the androgen response-element consensus-binding motif. These results identify previously uncharacterized and unsuspected genes whose expression levels are directly or indirectly regulated by androgens; further, they provide a comprehensive temporal view of the transcriptional program of human androgen-responsive cells.

We examined changes in gene expression occurring 2, 4, and 6 d after androgen deprivation and 2 d after androgen supplementation after being deprived of androgen for 2 or 4 d. Changes in transcript levels were investigated for mediators of androgen action; selected genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, and changes at the protein levels were examined. Four distinct patterns of gene expression were activated after androgen withdrawal; the vast majority of genes displayed an early or late transient increase in expression levels. A differential ability of rescue was seen among androgen-regulated genes, depending on time of androgen supplementation. Many of the genes that were rescued at 4 d were functionally linked by direct interactions and converged on IGF-I. The ability for rescue after 4 d of androgen deprivation was severely compromised in many genes belonging to specific functional gene families (cell adhesion, cell growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle) and may be mediated in part by changes in androgen receptor coregulator expression. These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of androgen regulation in epididymal principal cells.

Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone interact with the androgen receptor to regulate vital aspects of prostate growth and function including cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, and secretory activity. Our objective in this study was to characterize the temporal program of transcription that reflects the cellular response to androgens and to identify specific androgen-regulated genes (ARGs) or gene networks that participate in these responses. We used cDNA microarrays representing about 20,000 distinct human genes to profile androgen-responsive transcripts in the LNCaP adenocarcinoma cell line and identified 146 genes with transcript alterations more than 3-fold. Of these, 103 encode proteins with described functional roles, and 43 represent transcripts that have yet to be characterized. Temporal gene expression profiles grouped the ARGs into four distinct cohorts. Five uncharacterized ARGs demonstrated exclusive or high expression levels in the prostate relative to other tissues studied. A search of available DNA sequence upstream of 28 ARGs identified 25 with homology to the androgen response-element consensus-binding motif. These results identify previously uncharacterized and unsuspected genes whose expression levels are directly or indirectly regulated by androgens; further, they provide a comprehensive temporal view of the transcriptional program of human androgen-responsive cells.

To distinguish the direct effects of androgens on this cell type, DNA microarrays were used to identify androgen-regulated genes in the mouse proximal caput epididymidis (PC-1) cell line. PC-1 cells display tissue- and caput-specific gene expression. We examined changes in gene expression occurring 2, 4, and 6 d after androgen deprivation and 2 d after androgen supplementation after being deprived of androgen for 2 or 4 d. Changes in transcript levels were investigated for mediators of androgen action; selected genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, and changes at the protein levels were examined. Four distinct patterns of gene expression were activated after androgen withdrawal; the vast majority of genes displayed an early or late transient increase in expression levels. A differential ability of rescue was seen among androgen-regulated genes, depending on time of androgen supplementation. Many of the genes that were rescued at 4 d were functionally linked by direct interactions and converged on IGF-I.

Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone interact with the androgen receptor to regulate vital aspects of prostate growth and function including cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, and secretory activity. Our objective in this study was to characterize the temporal program of transcription that reflects the cellular response to androgens and to identify specific androgen-regulated genes (ARGs) or gene networks that participate in these responses. We used cDNA microarrays representing about 20,000 distinct human genes to profile androgen-responsive transcripts in the LNCaP adenocarcinoma cell line and identified 146 genes with transcript alterations more than 3-fold. Of these, 103 encode proteins with described functional roles, and 43 represent transcripts that have yet to be characterized. Temporal gene expression profiles grouped the ARGs into four distinct cohorts. Five uncharacterized ARGs demonstrated exclusive or high expression levels in the prostate relative to other tissues studied. A search of available DNA sequence upstream of 28 ARGs identified 25 with homology to the androgen response-element consensus-binding motif. These results identify previously uncharacterized and unsuspected genes whose expression levels are directly or indirectly regulated by androgens; further, they provide a comprehensive temporal view of the transcriptional program of human androgen-responsive cells.

Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone interact with the androgen receptor to regulate vital aspects of prostate growth and function including cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, and secretory activity. Our objective in this study was to characterize the temporal program of transcription that reflects the cellular response to androgens and to identify specific androgen-regulated genes (ARGs) or gene networks that participate in these responses. We used cDNA microarrays representing about 20,000 distinct human genes to profile androgen-responsive transcripts in the LNCaP adenocarcinoma cell line and identified 146 genes with transcript alterations more than 3-fold. Of these, 103 encode proteins with described functional roles, and 43 represent transcripts that have yet to be characterized. Temporal gene expression profiles grouped the ARGs into four distinct cohorts. Five uncharacterized ARGs demonstrated exclusive or high expression levels in the prostate relative to other tissues studied. A search of available DNA sequence upstream of 28 ARGs identified 25 with homology to the androgen response-element consensus-binding motif. These results identify previously uncharacterized and unsuspected genes whose expression levels are directly or indirectly regulated by androgens; further, they provide a comprehensive temporal view of the transcriptional program of human androgen-responsive cells.

Co-transfection reporter assay revealed that DEC1 and, to greater extent, DEC2 as well as hypoxia-repressed MLH1 promoter activity. We further found that the action was remarkably inhibited by trichostatin A, and identified a possible DEC-response element in the MLH1 promoter. In vitro electrophoretic gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DEC1 or 2 directly bounds to the suggested element, and transient transfection assay revealed that overexpression of DEC2 repressed endogenous MLH1 expression in the cells.

Furthermore, mutation of CRE abolishes SREBP-dependent activation after overexpression of SREBP-1a and CRE binding protein (CREB). This shows that CRE is essential, and that under ex vivo conditions CREB and SREBP cooperate in transactivating CYP51. Interestingly, protein kinase A shows a marked stimulation of the CYP51 promoter activity when overexpressed together with SREBP-1a but not when overexpressed with CREB, suggesting phosphorylation of SREBP-1a. Using a DNA probe containing all three regulatory elements, it is found that SREBP-1a, a CREB-like factor, and specificity protein (Sp1) all probably bind the CYP51 promoter. While SREBP-1a and the CRE-bound proteins are essential for the SREBP-dependent response, Sp1 apparently functions only to maximize sterol regulation of CYP51.

The additive influence of three cis-acting elements is responsible for this regulation in an adrenal carcinoma cell line. Two sites, CRE2 at -48 base pairs (bp) relative to the start of transcription and CRE3 at +95 bp, are identical to the core motif of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) of the somatostatin gene and are conserved in the mouse, rat, and human ODC genes. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in a substantial decrease in basal promoter activity, as well as a 5-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter by PKA. CRE3 did not contribute to the basal activity of the ODC promoter, but mutation of this site resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility by PKA. Deletion of a 45-bp sequence (GC-box) located 5p of CRE2, also resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter. DNase I protection revealed the presence of protein binding at CRE2, the TATA box, and the GC-box of the ODC promoter. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in loss of protection of this sequence, as well as the 3p extension of the footprint over the TATA box, without affecting interactions at the GC box. Antibodies to the well characterized CRE-binding protein CREB recognized proteins binding to CRE2, suggesting that binding of CREB, or an antigenically related protein, is important for the activity of CRE2. Additionally, recombinant CREB bound to a DNA probe containing the CRE2 sequence.

24560	11004	 2720	TGFBR Family	Protein	TAGLN	mRNA	-1	1	12547711	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a central role in promoting extracellular matrix protein deposition by promoting the transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. To gain new insights into the transcriptional programs involved, we profiled human fetal lung fibroblast global gene expression in response to TGF-beta1 up to 24 hours using oligonucleotide microarrays. In this report, we present data for 146 genes that were up-regulated at least twofold at two time points. These genes group into several major functional categories, including genes involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (n = 30), matrix formation (n = 25), metabolism and protein biosynthesis (n = 27), cell signaling (n = 21), proliferation and survival (n = 13), gene transcription (n = 9), and of uncertain function (n = 21). For 80 of these genes, this is the first report that they are TGF-beta1-responsive. The early induction of two members of the inhibitor of differentiation (ID) family of transcriptional regulators, ID1 and ID3, was followed by the up-regulation of a number of genes that are usually expressed by highly differentiated smooth muscle cells, including smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, basic calponin, and smoothelin. These findings were confirmed at the protein level for primary adult lung fibroblasts. ID1 further behaved like a typical immediate-early gene and, unlike ID3, was expressed and induced at the protein level. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ID1 was highly expressed by (myo)fibroblasts within fibrotic foci in experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis. ID1 acts as a dominant-negative antagonist of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that drive cell lineage commitment and differentiation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of fibroblast transcriptional programming in response to TGF-beta1 during development, oncogenesis, tissue repair, and fibrosis.

33987	11004	14547	TGFBR Family	Protein	KRT18	mRNA	0	1	12547711	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a central role in promoting extracellular matrix protein deposition by promoting the transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. To gain new insights into the transcriptional programs involved, we profiled human fetal lung fibroblast global gene expression in response to TGF-beta1 up to 24 hours using oligonucleotide microarrays. In this report, we present data for 146 genes that were up-regulated at least twofold at two time points. These genes group into several major functional categories, including genes involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (n = 30), matrix formation (n = 25), metabolism and protein biosynthesis (n = 27), cell signaling (n = 21), proliferation and survival (n = 13), gene transcription (n = 9), and of uncertain function (n = 21). For 80 of these genes, this is the first report that they are TGF-beta1-responsive. The early induction of two members of the inhibitor of differentiation (ID) family of transcriptional regulators, ID1 and ID3, was followed by the up-regulation of a number of genes that are usually expressed by highly differentiated smooth muscle cells, including smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, basic calponin, and smoothelin. These findings were confirmed at the protein level for primary adult lung fibroblasts. ID1 further behaved like a typical immediate-early gene and, unlike ID3, was expressed and induced at the protein level. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ID1 was highly expressed by (myo)fibroblasts within fibrotic foci in experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis. ID1 acts as a dominant-negative antagonist of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that drive cell lineage commitment and differentiation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of fibroblast transcriptional programming in response to TGF-beta1 during development, oncogenesis, tissue repair, and fibrosis.

GATA2, a marker of skeletal muscle hypertrophy (44), does not affect BVR transcription. Biliverdin Reductase: An Intracellular Transporter? There is the likelihood that in higher forms of life the conserved COOH-terminal-domain cysteines within the HCX10CC/H motif and the extensive beta- sheet in this domain are involved in interactions with other proteins, sulfhydryl reagents, in Zn/metal binding, and in dimerization; native hBVR is a Zn metalloprotein (27, 36). Functions that are assigned to this cysteine-rich domain include: 1) being the interaction site for het- erodimerization with kinases/signaling molecules and homodimerization (1); 2) its function as a \molecular switch\ in cell signaling through to -SS- interconversion; and, 3) being the site of interaction with substrate/cofactor and heme (40). The involvement of BVR in intracellular trafficking of signaling factors is consistent with the observation that BVR interacts with the insulin receptor kinase (IRK) domain (29) and localizes into the nucleus upon activation by cGMP (33). The proposed function of BVR in protein:protein interaction and intracellular transport of signaling factors is based on its kinase activity, its primary structural features, and the secondary structure of the COOH-terminal domain as a large beta-sheet made of six strands; such a structure characterizes a monomer-monomer interface site, similar to those found in intracellular-trafficking \scaffold\ proteins. Notably, two copies of the CX10C motif are present in the C1 domain of PKCs (42, 46). Oxidation of cysteine residues to the disulfide form (or covalently bonding with -SH-reactive compounds) prevents BVR dimerization and reductase activity (27). Homodimeric BVR is incapable of docking with other proteins, and this could arise from exposure to factors that affect the oxidation state of the cell and/or have affinity for sulfhydryls. Protein sulfhydryls are a target for the NO- radical (4), for example. Over two decades ago, when little was known about the primary and secondary structure of BVR, observations were made that were unexplainable at the time but when revisited in light of the current information offer support for the function of cysteine residues in BVR protein:protein interactions. In one study rat BVR was characterized as \extremely sensitive\ to -SH-reactive reagents, although biliverdin was found to fully protect the enzyme (27). Another observation (16) was the \interconversion\ of two molecular forms of rat liver BVR; a ~34-kDa form was converted to a larger molecular form (~68 kDa) when rats were treated with -SH-reactive agents. Reduced thioredoxin, an agent that can reduce disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl groups, could reverse the conversion. The larger form was found to lack sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents. These observations would suggest occurrence of dynamic interchange between mono- and dimeric forms of BVR as the consequence of sulfhydryl disulfide interconversion in vivo. Regulation of Oxidative Response and HO-1 Expression Regulation of HO-1 by means of reductase and transcriptional activities may serve as a paradigm for gene regulation of oxidative-response gene expression by BVR. The first direct link between BVR and HO-1 response was provided by a study that demonstrated nuclear localization of BVR in rat kidneys in response to inducers of HO-1, such as bromobenzene and bacterial LPS (33).

35874	  571	19603	BLVRA	Protein	ATF2	mRNA	1	1	16287987	GATA1 is a key factor in lineage-specific development of stem cells and may be indicative of a function for BVR in the establishment of gene-expression profiles in developing stem cells. GATA2, a marker of skeletal muscle hypertrophy (44), does not affect BVR transcription. Biliverdin Reductase: An Intracellular Transporter? There is the likelihood that in higher forms of life the conserved COOH-terminal-domain cysteines within the HCX10CC/H motif and the extensive beta- sheet in this domain are involved in interactions with other proteins, sulfhydryl reagents, in Zn/metal binding, and in dimerization; native hBVR is a Zn metalloprotein (27, 36). Functions that are assigned to this cysteine-rich domain include: 1) being the interaction site for het- erodimerization with kinases/signaling molecules and homodimerization (1); 2) its function as a \molecular switch\ in cell signaling through to -SS- interconversion; and, 3) being the site of interaction with substrate/cofactor and heme (40). The involvement of BVR in intracellular trafficking of signaling factors is consistent with the observation that BVR interacts with the insulin receptor kinase (IRK) domain (29) and localizes into the nucleus upon activation by cGMP (33). The proposed function of BVR in protein:protein interaction and intracellular transport of signaling factors is based on its kinase activity, its primary structural features, and the secondary structure of the COOH-terminal domain as a large beta-sheet made of six strands; such a structure characterizes a monomer-monomer interface site, similar to those found in intracellular-trafficking \scaffold\ proteins. Notably, two copies of the CX10C motif are present in the C1 domain of PKCs (42, 46). Oxidation of cysteine residues to the disulfide form (or covalently bonding with -SH-reactive compounds) prevents BVR dimerization and reductase activity (27). Homodimeric BVR is incapable of docking with other proteins, and this could arise from exposure to factors that affect the oxidation state of the cell and/or have affinity for sulfhydryls. Protein sulfhydryls are a target for the NO- radical (4), for example. Over two decades ago, when little was known about the primary and secondary structure of BVR, observations were made that were unexplainable at the time but when revisited in light of the current information offer support for the function of cysteine residues in BVR protein:protein interactions. In one study rat BVR was characterized as \extremely sensitive\ to -SH-reactive reagents, although biliverdin was found to fully protect the enzyme (27). Another observation (16) was the \interconversion\ of two molecular forms of rat liver BVR; a ~34-kDa form was converted to a larger molecular form (~68 kDa) when rats were treated with -SH-reactive agents. Reduced thioredoxin, an agent that can reduce disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl groups, could reverse the conversion. The larger form was found to lack sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents. These observations would suggest occurrence of dynamic interchange between mono- and dimeric forms of BVR as the consequence of sulfhydryl disulfide interconversion in vivo. Regulation of Oxidative Response and HO-1 Expression Regulation of HO-1 by means of reductase and transcriptional activities may serve as a paradigm for gene regulation of oxidative-response gene expression by BVR. The first direct link between BVR and HO-1 response was provided by a study that demonstrated nuclear localization of BVR in rat kidneys in response to inducers of HO-1, such as bromobenzene and bacterial LPS (33). BVR nuclear localization is an active process and requires an intact nuclear localization signal (FIGURE 1) (33). Gene-array analysis suggests that BVR activates a large number of genes in cell-signaling pathways, immune, and stress-response, and further analysis showed that, indeed, ho-1 and activating transcription factor (ATF-2)/cAMP re...

55582	17546	16323	Estrogens	Compound	BSG	mRNA	0	1	12211060	Basigin, a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been shown to be essential for fertilization and implantation. The aim of this study was to determine the expression and hormonal regulation of basigin gene in mouse uterus during the peri-implantation period. Basigin immunostaining and mRNA were strongly localized in luminal and glandular epithelium on day 1 of pregnancy and gradually decreased to a basal level from day 2-4 of pregnancy. Basigin mRNA expression in the sub-luminal stroma was first detected on day 3 of pregnancy and increased on day 4 of pregnancy. On day 5 of pregnancy, the expression of basigin protein and mRNA was only detected in the implanting embryos, and the luminal epithelium and sub-luminal stroma surrounding the embryos. A similar expression pattern of basigin was also induced in the delayed-implantation uterus which was activated by estrogen injection. On day 6-8 of pregnancy, although a basal level of basigin protein was detected in the secondary decidual zone, basigin mRNA expression was strongly seen in this location. Basigin mRNA was also highly expressed in the decidualized cells under artificial decidualization. Estrogen significantly stimulated basigin expression in the ovariectomized mouse uterus. A high level of basigin immunostaining and mRNA was also seen in proestrus and estrus uteri. These results suggest that basigin expression is closely related to mouse implantation and up-regulated by estrogen.

(1986) were the first to report the identification of a second form of HO from rat liver microsomes, designated HO-2. Only recently, a third isoform, HO-3, was discovered (McCoubrey et al., 1997). HO-1 and HO-2 share little similarity in amino acid sequence (40%), whereas the HO-2 and HO-3 isoform are far more homologous (90%). All HO isoforms are highly conserved among species in evolution. HO is expressed in virtually all life forms; in prokaryotic bacteria as well as in fungi, plants, and humans, regulating a wide spectrum of cellular processes (Terry et al., 2002). The homology between rat, mouse, and human is for HO-1 and HO-2 proteins higher than 80% and 90%, respectively.  Under normal physiological conditions, most cells express low or undetectable levels of HO-1 protein, whereas HO-2 proteins are constitutively expressed. HO-3 protein expression awaits further characterization. HO-2 transcription is only up-regulated by few agents, such as opiates and adrenal glucocorticoids (Li and David Clark, 2000; Liu et al., 2000).  HO-1 gene expression is highly inducible by more diverse stimuli than any other enzyme described to date (Maines, 1997) and involves a multitude of signaling pathways (Table 2) (Immenschuh and Ramadori, 2000). HO-1 expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level.     View this table: [in this window] [in a new window] TABLE 2 Selection of different inducers of HO-1 gene expression

In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase I/II multicenter trial, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer patients and gene carriers received either celecoxib at one of two doses or placebo. The goal was to evaluate the effects of these treatment arms on a number of endoscopic and tissue-based biomarker end points after 12 months of treatment. As part of this trial, we analyzed gene expression by cDNA array technology in normal descending (rectal) colonic mucosa of patients before and after treatment with celecoxib or placebo. We found that treatment of patients with celecoxib at recommended clinical doses (200 and 400 mg p.o. bid), in contrast to treatment with placebo, leads to changes in expression of >1,400 genes in the healthy colon, although in general, the magnitude of changes is <2-fold. Twenty-three of 25 pairs of colon biopsies taken before and after celecoxib treatment can be classified correctly by the pattern of gene expression in a leave-one-out cross-validation. Immune response, particularly T- and B-lymphocyte activation and early steps of inflammatory reaction, cell signaling and cell adhesion, response to stress, transforming growth factor-beta signaling, and regulation of apoptosis, are the main biological processes targeted by celecoxib as shown by overrepresentation analysis of the distribution of celecoxib-affected genes across Gene Ontology categories. Analysis of possible cumulative effects of celecoxib-induced changes in gene expression indicates that in healthy colon, celecoxib may suppress the immune response and early steps of inflammation, inhibit formation of focal contacts, and stimulate transforming growth factor-beta signaling.

39575	16696	13744	Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid	Compound	CDKN1B	mRNA	-1	1	11126200	BACKGROUND: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a prototype of the newly developed, second-generation, hybrid polar compounds. It is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor with high potency for inducing cell differentiation of cultured murine erythroleukemia cells. Studies with SAHA have primarily been performed with hematopoietic tumor cells. Here we extent these studies with SAHA to human breast cancer cell lines in an attempt to find better therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435, as well as normal cells, including the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A, and fibroblasts, were treated with SAHA. Cells assayed for cell survival by using trypan blue exclusion assay, colony formation assay, and cell cycle and apoptosis analysis. The effects of SAHA on cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins were examined by Western blots analysis. The identification of additional target genes was carried out by differential display (DD) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: SAHA inhibited clonogenic growth of MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. These cells were more sensitive to SAHA-mediated cytotoxic effects than normal breast epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The cytotoxic effects of SAHA on breast cancer cells were manifested by G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest and eventual apoptosis. The pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD.fmk, blocked SAHA-induced cell death, DNA laddering, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, indicating the involvement of caspases in SAHA-mediated apoptosis. In addition, SAHA modulated cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins. For example, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 were induced, and retinoblastoma protein pRb was hypophosphorylated. Moreover, SAHA induced several genes associated with differentiation and/ or growth inhibition. These genes encode gelsolin, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase (IDI1), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1), the last two of which were identified by DD. Induction of these genes may contribute to SAHA-mediated pro-differentiating and antiproliferative effects. CONCLUSIONS: SAHA induced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and eventual apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, possibly by modulating cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins, such as CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, pRb, and other differentiation and/or growth inhibition-associated genes, including gelsolin, IDI1 and VDUP1. This, together with the low toxicity in normal cells, suggests that SAHA might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of human breast cancers.

24311	   99	 7440	PBX2	Protein	PF4	mRNA	0	1	12609849	Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is expressed during megakaryocytic differentiation. We previously reported that GATA-1 and ETS-1 regulate the rat PF4 promoter and transactivate the PF4 gene. For the present study, we investigated the regulatory elements and their transcription factors responsible for the lineage-specific expression of the PF4 gene. The promoter activities of deletion constructs were evaluated, and a novel regulatory element termed TME (tandem repeat of MEIS1 binding element) (-219 to -182) was defined. Binding proteins to TME were strongly detected in HEL nuclear extracts by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), and they were purified by DNA affinity chromatography. By performing Western blottings and supershift assays, the binding proteins were identified as homeodomain proteins, MEIS1, PBX1B, and PBX2. These factors are expressed in megakaryocytes differentiated from CD34+ cells in human cord blood. MEIS1 and PBXs bind to the TME as MEIS1/PBX complexes and activate the PF4 promoter. In nonmegakaryocytic HepG2 cells, GATA-1 and ETS-1 activate the PF4 promoter approximately 10-fold. Surprisingly, we found that additional expression of both MEIS1 and PBX2 multiplied this major activation another 2-fold. This activation was not observed when MEIS1 binding sites in the TME were disrupted. Furthermore, inhibition of the binding of endogenous MEIS1/PBX complexes to the TME decreased the promoter activity by almost one half, in megakaryocytic HEL cells. Thus, these studies demonstrate that the homeodomain proteins, MEIS1, PBX1B, and PBX2, play an important role in megakaryocytic gene expression.

17712	12713	13919	trichostatin A	Compound	RECK	mRNA	0	1	12810630	Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known toexert antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. RECK is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein that negatively regulates matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) and inhibits tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Inthis study, we test the possibility that HDAC inhibitor may increase RECKexpression to inhibit MMP activation and cancer cell invasion. Our resultsshowed that trichostatin A (TSA) up-regulated RECK via transcriptionalactivation in CL-1 human lung cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysisdemonstrated that RECK protein on cell surface was increased after treatment ofTSA. Moreover, up-regulation of RECK expression by TSA attenuated MMP-2activity. To explore whether HDAC inhibitor-induced inhibition of MMP-2activation is indeed mediated via RECK, we used small interference RNA (siRNA)to block RECK expression and found that inhibition of RECK by siRNA abolishedthe inhibitory effect of TSA on MMP-2 activation. In addition, TSA suppressedthe invasive ability of CL-1 cells. Taken together, this study reveals a novelmechanism by which HDAC inhibitors suppress tumor invasion and provides a newstrategy for cancer therapy.

58552	12713	  497	trichostatin A	Compound	SIRT1	mRNA	-1	-1	14523559	The Sir2 histone deacetylase gene family consists of seven mammalian sirtuins (SIRTs) which are NAD-dependent histone/protein deacetylases. Sir2 proteins regulate, for instance, genome stability by chromatin silencing in yeast. In mammals, their function is still largely unknown. Due to the NAD+ dependency, Sir2 might be the link between metabolic activity and histone/protein acetylation. Regulation of gene expression also seems to play an important role in Sir2 functions, since increasing the dosage of Sir2 genes increases genome stability in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. We observed that the modification of histone/protein acetylation status by several class I and II histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induces differential changes in gene expression profiles of seven SIRT mRNAs in cultured neuronal cells. SIRT2, SIRT4 and SIRT7 were upregulated, whereas SIRT1, SIRT5 and SIRT6 were downregulated by trichostatin A (TSA) and n-butyrate. The upregulation of SIRT mRNAs was inhibited by actinomycin D. Interestingly, the regulation of SIRT mRNAs was highly similar both in mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells and post-mitotic rat primary hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation technique, we showed that the upregulation of SIRT2 expression with TSA is related to the hyperacetylation of DNA-bound histone H4 within the first 500 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the SIRT2 gene. Chemically different types of HDAC inhibitors, such as TSA, apicidin, SAHA, M344 and n-butyrate induced remarkably similar responses in SIRT1-7 mRNA expression patterns.

23043	18088	 5147	ciprofibrate	Compound	NUPR1	mRNA	1	1	12851464	Fibrate class hypolipidemic drugs such as ciprofibrate activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), which is involved in processes including lipid metabolism and hepatocyte proliferation in rodents. We examined the effects of ciprofibrate (50 mg/kg body wt per day for 60 days) on liver gene expression in rats using cDNA microarrays. The 60-day dosing period was chosen to elucidate both the metabolic and proliferative actions of this substance, while avoiding confounding effects from the hepatic carcinogenesis seen during more long-term stimulation. Ciprofibrate changed the expression of many genes including previously known PPARalpha agonist-responsive genes involved in processes such as lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. In addition, many novel candidate genes involved in sugar metabolism, transcription, signal transduction, cell proliferation, and stress responses appeared to be differentially regulated in ciprofibrate-dosed rats. Ciprofibrate also resulted in significant increases in liver weight and hepatocyte proliferation. The cDNA microarray results were confirmed by Northern blot analysis for selected genes. This study thus identifies many genes that appear to be differentially regulated in ciprofibrate-dosed rats, and some of these are potential targets of PPARalpha. The functional diversity of these candidate genes suggests that most of them are likely to be differentially regulated as indirect consequence of the many processes affected by ciprofibrate in rodent liver. Although caution is advisable in the interpretation of genome-wide expression data, the genes identified in the present study provide candidates for further studies that may give new insight into the mechanisms of action of peroxisome proliferators.

35607	18088	 1571	ciprofibrate	Compound	RBL2	mRNA	-1	1	12851464	Fibrate class hypolipidemic drugs such as ciprofibrate activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), which is involved in processes including lipid metabolism and hepatocyte proliferation in rodents. We examined the effects of ciprofibrate (50 mg/kg body wt per day for 60 days) on liver gene expression in rats using cDNA microarrays. The 60-day dosing period was chosen to elucidate both the metabolic and proliferative actions of this substance, while avoiding confounding effects from the hepatic carcinogenesis seen during more long-term stimulation. Ciprofibrate changed the expression of many genes including previously known PPARalpha agonist-responsive genes involved in processes such as lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. In addition, many novel candidate genes involved in sugar metabolism, transcription, signal transduction, cell proliferation, and stress responses appeared to be differentially regulated in ciprofibrate-dosed rats. Ciprofibrate also resulted in significant increases in liver weight and hepatocyte proliferation. The cDNA microarray results were confirmed by Northern blot analysis for selected genes. This study thus identifies many genes that appear to be differentially regulated in ciprofibrate-dosed rats, and some of these are potential targets of PPARalpha. The functional diversity of these candidate genes suggests that most of them are likely to be differentially regulated as indirect consequence of the many processes affected by ciprofibrate in rodent liver. Although caution is advisable in the interpretation of genome-wide expression data, the genes identified in the present study provide candidates for further studies that may give new insight into the mechanisms of action of peroxisome proliferators.

39432	17925	14790	ceramide	Compound	MAP3K5	mRNA	0	1	11029458	Cells differentiate in response to various extracellular stimuli. This cellular response requires intracellular signaling pathways. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade is a core signal transduction pathway that determines the fate of many kinds of cell. MAP kinase kinase kinase activates MAP kinase kinase, which in turn activates MAP kinase. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) was identified as a MAP kinase kinase kinase involved in the stress-induced apoptosis-signaling cascade that activates the SEK1-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 MAP kinase cascades. Expression of the constitutively active form of ASK1 (ASK1-DeltaN) in keratinocytes induced significant morphological changes and differentiation markers, transglutaminase-1, loricrin, and involucrin. A transient increase in p21(Cip1/WAF1) reduced DNA synthesis, and cell cycle analysis verified the differentiation. p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, SB202190 and SB203580, abolished the induction of differentiation markers, transglutaminase-1, loricrin, and involucrin. In turn, the induction of differentiation with ceramide in keratinocytes caused an increase in ASK1 expression and activity. Furthermore, normal human skin expresses ASK1 protein in the upper epidermis, implicating ASK1 in in vivo keratinocyte differentiation. We propose that the ASK1-p38 MAP kinase cascade is a new intracellular regulator of keratinocyte differentiation.

62937	 9134	 7195	U2AF1	Protein	GADD45A	mRNA	-1	1	16855028	U2AF is a heterodimeric splicing factor composed of a large (U2AF(65)) and a small (U2AF(35)) subunit. In humans, alternative splicing generates two U2AF(35) variants, U2AF(35)a and U2AF(35)b. Here, we used RNA interference to specifically ablate the expression of each isoform in HeLa cells. Our results show that knockdown of the major U2AF(35)a isoform reduced cell viability and impaired mitotic progression, leading to accumulation of cells in prometaphase. Microarray analysis revealed that knockdown of U2AF(35)a affected the expression level of approximately 500 mRNAs, from which 90% were underrepresented relative to the control. Among mRNAs underrepresented in U2AF(35)a-depleted cells we identified an essential cell cycle gene, Cdc27, for which there was an increase in the ratio between unspliced and spliced RNA and a significant reduction in protein level. Furthermore, we show that depletion of either U2AF(35)a or U2AF(35)b altered the ratios of alternatively spliced isoforms of Cdc25B and Cdc25C transcripts. Taken together our results demonstrate that U2AF(35)a is essential for HeLa cell division and suggest a novel role for both U2AF(35) protein isoforms as regulators of alternative splicing of a specific subset of genes.

Upon transfection of a COX-2 promoter-driven reporter gene into the amnion fibroblasts, cortisol stimulated the COX-2 promoter activity. This was abolished by mutagenesis of a cAMP response element (CRE) at -53 to approximately -59bp as well as by cotransfection of a plasmid expressing dominant-negative CRE-binding protein (CREB). The phosphorylation level of CREB-1 was significantly increased by cortisol treatment of the amnion fibroblasts.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that the binding of CREB-1 to the CRE of the COX-2 promoter was increased by cortisol treatment of the amnion fibroblasts.

These include genes involved in retinoic acid signaling that are known to impact male fertility (Livera et al. 2002). Retinoic acid receptor gamma, which has been shown to control expression of Stra8 (Chiba et al. 1997), is expressed at lower levels in Taf4b-null testis (Fig. 6C). Other retinoic acid signaling molecules, including cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (Crabp) and retinol-binding protein (Rbp), are reduced in Taf4b-null testis as well (Fig. 6C).

Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays according to the manufacturer?s instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).A Custom CDF Version 11 with Entrez-based gene definitions was used to annotate the arrays (28). Raw fluorescence intensity values were normalized, applying quantile normalization. Differential gene expression was analyzed based on log linear mixed model analysis of variance (29) using the commercial software package SAS JMP7 Genomics, version 3.1 from SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A false positive rate of   0.05 with Holm correction was taken as level of significance. To be significantly regulated, only genes with a -fold change of 1.5 and a p value less than or equal to the threshold estimated by the Holm multiple testing algorithm, as compared with the empty vector without 4OHT, were considered. Additionally, genes with a significantly different regulation between FOXO3.A3.ER and FOXO3.A3.ER.H212R according to Holm correction and a 2-fold differential regulation between FOXO3.A3.ER and FOXO3.A3.ER.H212R were resorted from the co-regulated group to FOXO3.A3.ER or FOXO3.A3.ER.H212R, respectively.

To provide insight into the role of PTEN mutations in prostate cancer, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells. These studies revealed that adenoviral overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line resulted in apoptosis and induced the expression of many genes that affect cellular proliferation or survival. The expression of one of these FOXO-regulated genes, TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor family, was decreased in human metastatic prostate tumors. The altered expression of TRAIL in these tumors correlated directly with decreased PTEN expression and the resultant loss of FKHRL1 and FKHR activity. Analysis of the effects of FOXO proteins on the TRAIL promoter localized the FKHRL1 responsive element of the TRAIL promoter to nucleotides -138 to -121 and demonstrated that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1. These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells.

39809	 7352	 7769	FOXO3	Protein	FOXO1	mRNA	-1	1	12351634	Mutations in PTEN occur in 60-80% of prostate cancers and lead to a constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and a resultant loss of activity of the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1 and FKHR. To provide insight into the role of PTEN mutations in prostate cancer, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells. These studies revealed that adenoviral overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line resulted in apoptosis and induced the expression of many genes that affect cellular proliferation or survival. The expression of one of these FOXO-regulated genes, TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor family, was decreased in human metastatic prostate tumors. The altered expression of TRAIL in these tumors correlated directly with decreased PTEN expression and the resultant loss of FKHRL1 and FKHR activity. Analysis of the effects of FOXO proteins on the TRAIL promoter localized the FKHRL1 responsive element of the TRAIL promoter to nucleotides -138 to -121 and demonstrated that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1. These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells.

11841	13399	16365	lipopolysaccharide	Compound	IL1A	mRNA	0	1	16207706	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of murine RAW 264.7 macrophages influences the expression of multiple genes through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We observed a 5-fold increase in CstF-64 expression following LPS treatment of RAW macrophages. The increase in CstF-64 protein was specific in that several other factors involved in 3p-end processing were not affected by LPS stimulation. Activation of RAW macrophages with LPS caused an increase in proximal poly(A) site selection within a reporter mini-gene containing two linked poly(A) sites that occurred concomitant with the increase in CstF-64 expression. Furthermore, forced overexpression of the CstF-64 protein also induced alternative poly(A) site selection on the reporter minigene. Microarray analysis performed on CstF-64 overexpressing RAW macrophages revealed that elevated levels of CstF-64 altered the expression of 51 genes, 14 of which showed similar changes in gene expression with LPS stimulation. Sequence analysis of the 3p-untranslated regions of these 51 genes revealed that over 45% possess multiple putative poly(A) sites. Two of these 51 genes demonstrated alternative polyadenylation under both LPS-stimulating and CstF-64-overexpressing conditions. We concluded that the physiologically increased levels of CstF-64 observed in LPS-stimulated RAW macrophages contribute to the changes in expression and alternative polyadenylation of a number of genes, thus identifying another level of gene regulation that occurs in macrophages activated with LPS.

BVR is the product of a single-copy gene that, in the rat, is 17,025 bp in length and consists of seven exons and six introns (38) (GenBank). The human BVR gene has eight exons, with the initiation codon in exon 2. Exon 5 includes the most strongly conserved motif, which is found in every oxidoreductase (30). In the rat, the ~1.6-kb transcript is expressed sparingly in organs such as the testis and the thymus but abundantly in others such as the kidney, spleen, liver, and brain. The promoter region of the human and rat genes contain consensus sequence elements (38) associated with regulation of transcriptional activity, embryonic gene expression, and response to hyperthermia (12, 39). In addition to hyperthermia, cytokines and LPS induce BVR transcription (33).

51310	 3500	17260	KLF11	Protein	MAOB	mRNA	0	1	15024015	Here, we show that cotransfection with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-inducible early gene (TIEG)2 increased MAO B gene expression at promoter, mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels in both SH-SY5Y and HepG2 cells. Mutation of the CACCC element increased the MAO B promoter activity, and cotransfection with TIEG2 further increased the promoter activity, suggesting that CACCC was a repressor element. This increase was reduced when the proximal Sp1 overlapping sites was mutated. Similar interactions were found with Sp3. These results showed that TIEG2 and Sp3 were repressors at the CACCC element but were activators at proximal Sp1 overlapping sites of MAO B. Gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that TIEG2 and Sp3 bound directly to CACCC element and the proximal Sp1 sites in both synthetic oligonucleotides and natural MAO B core promoter. TIEG2 had a higher affinity to Sp1 sites than CACCC element, whereas Sp3 had an equal affinity to both elements. Thus, TIEG2 was an activator, but Sp3 had no effect on MAO B gene expression.

Besides a previously described GC box, we further identified a CACCC box within the hInsP, both putative KLF11-binding motifs. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) verified binding of in vitro translated hKLF11 to the GC box, but neither hKLF11-induced inhibition nor basal hInsP activity was altered by mutation or 5p-deletion of the GC box.

Hox D3 expression in endothelial cells enhances integrin alpha5 protein and message expression, whereas Hox D3 antisense inhibits its expression. Hox D3 promotes alpha5 expression during angiogenesis in vivo, whereas inhibition of alpha5 expression by Hox D3 antisense suppresses angiogenesis.

65430	 2983	19519	trans10,cis12-Octadecadienoate	Compound	CPT1A	mRNA	-1	1	16868072	A combined histological and microarray analysis of the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) was performed to better define functional responses. Mice fed t10c12 CLA for 14 days lost 85% of WAT mass, 95% of adipocyte lipid droplet volume, and 15% or 47% of the number of adipocytes and total cells, respectively. Microarray profiling of replicated pools (n = 2 per day x diet) of control and treated mice (n = 140) at seven time points after 1 to 17 days of t10c12 CLA feeding found between 2798 and 4318 transcript levels changed by 2-fold or more. Transcript levels for genes involved in glucose and fatty acid import or biosynthesis were significantly reduced. Highly expressed transcripts for lipases were only moderately reduced suggesting lipolysis and fatty acid export continued to occur. Increased levels of mRNAs for two key thermogenesis proteins, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, may have increased energy expenditures. Significant reductions of mRNAs for major adipocyte regulatory factors, including PPARgamma, SREBP1, CAAT/enhancer binding proteinalpha, and Lipin 1 were correlated with the reduced transcript levels for key metabolic pathways in the WAT. A prolific inflammation response was indicated by the 2- to 100-fold induction of many cytokine transcripts, including those for IL-6, IL1beta, TNF ligands, and CXC family members, and an increased density of macrophages. The combination of cell loss, increased energy expenditure, and transport of lipids out of the adipocytes may account for the cumulative mass loss observed.

Recent progress in dissecting underlying molecular mechanisms, identifying target factors and target genes, and uncovering physiological functions points to the regulatory involvement of SHP in diverse metabolic and intracellular pathways that awaits future clarification. In this review, we carry out a comprehensive survey of all published data and discuss our current understanding of molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences governing SHP action.

The fact that baseline transcriptional activity of construct I-b1[HNF1]mut was also markedly attenuated compared with that of the wild-type construct (4.5-fold; Figure 11A) suggested that an HNF1-bound transcription factor forms part of the baseline transcription machinery of AE2 {SLC4A2}alternate promoter in intact liver cells. ChIP assays against HNF1alpha in nuclear extracts from PLC/PRF/5 cells (with and without treatments) further supported such a view.

OGDH enzyme activity and [(14)C]pyruvate oxidation were also reduced. In contrast, the mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 were dramatically increased by HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC induction.

To gain insight into this circuitry, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter microarrays to identify systematically the genes occupied by the transcriptional regulators HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, and HNF6, together with RNA polymerase II, in human liver and pancreatic islets. We identified tissue-specific regulatory circuits formed by HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, and HNF6 with other transcription factors, revealing how these factors function as master regulators of hepatocyte and islet transcription. Our results suggest how misregulation of HNF4alpha can contribute to type 2 diabetes.

In addition, we determined that the expression of several islet-enriched transcription factors, including Pdx-1, Hnf-4alpha, and Neuro-D1/Beta-2, was reduced in Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice. These changes in pancreatic islet mRNA levels were already apparent in newborn animals, suggesting that loss of Hnf-1alpha function rather than chronic hyperglycemia is the primary cause of the altered gene expression. This expression profile was pancreatic islet-specific and distinct from hepatocytes...

The induction of the Gadd genes suggested that JNK2AS-treated cells were under stress and prompted us to examine the expression of two other stress-regulated genes: (a) Grp78, a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding; and (b) the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1, which we had found previously to be up-regulated in other JNK2AS-treated cells (17 , 18) . Both genes were markedly up-regulated in JNK2AS-treated cells (Fig. 4C)Citation , suggesting that depletion of JNK2 in PC3 cells facilitates the induction of several independent stress-signaling pathways. Activation of the JNK pathway is important for the phosphorylation and activation of protein components of AP-1 transcription factor complexes (1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7 , 28) , suggesting that genes regulated by AP-1-dependent transcription could be negatively affected by JNKAS treatment.

Importantly, although most JNK2AS-altered genes appeared to be specific for treatment with this oligonucleotide, some gene expression changes were also seen in the JNK1AS- and JNKScr-treated groups, indicating that a more global response to the uptake of oligonucleotides (Fig. 4E)Citation was elicited. Within this group were two IFN-inducible genes, ISGF-3 and ISG15, suggesting that application of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides could induce IFN-dependent responses.

The induction of the Gadd genes suggested that JNK2AS-treated cells were under stress and prompted us to examine the expression of two other stress-regulated genes: (a) Grp78, a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding; and (b) the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1, which we had found previously to be up-regulated in other JNK2AS-treated cells (17 , 18) . Both genes were markedly up-regulated in JNK2AS-treated cells (Fig. 4C)Citation , suggesting that depletion of JNK2 in PC3 cells facilitates the induction of several independent stress-signaling pathways. Activation of the JNK pathway is important for the phosphorylation and activation of protein components of AP-1 transcription factor complexes (1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7 , 28) , suggesting that genes regulated by AP-1-dependent transcription could be negatively affected by JNKAS treatment.

12016	  814	13964	TFAP2A	Protein	PLTP	mRNA	0	1	11573953	Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) plays an important role in the metabolism of plasma high density lipoprotein. The mouse gene encoding PLTP and its promoter region has been cloned in our laboratory. The present study was conducted to functionally analyze the transcriptional regulation of the mouse PLTP gene. The results indicated that DNA sequences between -245 and -69 were responsible for the full promoter activity and binding motifs for transcription factor Sp1 and AP-2 within this functional promoter region were synergistically essential for the basal transcription. The transcriptional activity of this gene was significantly increased by chenodeoxycholic acid and fenofibrate, suggesting that transcription factor farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) are likely involved in the transcriptional regulation. DNA sequence analysis suggests that DNA sequences from -407 to -395 and from -393 to -381 are homologous to the recognition motifs of FXR, and those from -859 to -847 and from -309 to -297 are similar to the potential binding motif for PPAR. These findings provide a molecular basis for further investigation of the physiological function and regulation of the PLTP gene in mice.

51660	 6509	14103	HOXC8	Protein	PGAM1	mRNA	1	1	12974468	Although Hox genes are known to mediate developmental decisions involved in pattern formation during embryogenesis, it is still not well understood what Hox regulates. In order to analyze Hoxc8 downstream target genes, a stable cell line overexpressing Hoxc8 was established using F9 murine teratocarcinoma cells, proteom samples were analyzed by 2-DE, and compared with controls. The protein spots having differences more than 4 fold in intensity were selected, analyzed by MALDI-TOF, and grouped in terms of putative function; cytoskeleton and motility (vimentin, gamma-actin, tropomyosin, and tubulin beta-5 chain); folding, modification and degradation of protein (GRP78, proteasome subunit alpha type 5, 26S proteasome regulatory subunit p27 protein, and PDIR); metabolism (ATP synthase beta subunit, Pgam1, and CAII); transcription/translation factors and general nucleic acid binding proteins (RbAp46, PCNA, eEF-1-beta, and nucleophosmin). Although it may not be significant, 50% of the genes were located on chromosomes 2 and 3, suggesting the possibility of a non-random distribution of Hox downstream genes. Almost 50% of the genes analyzed showed some relation with Hox protein directly or indirectly; i.e., tubulin beta 5, EF-1 beta and PCNA have been reported to contain putative Hox binding regulatory sites and genes like vimentin, pgam1 and nucleophosmin to be regulated by RA, a potent modulator of Hox expression. These results altogether imply that proteom analysis could be a possible tool for the analysis of the potent Hox realizator genes, which provides a new insight into the function of Hox on pattern formation during embryogenesis.

Progestins are compounds that demonstrate progesterone-like activity and are used in oral contraception, hormone therapy, and treatment of some reproductive disorders, but differ widely in their chemical structures, potency, and pharmacokinetics. While numerous studies have assessed progestins on specific endpoints, little is known about the activation of global gene expression by progestins. We used Affymetrix GeneChip U133A expression arrays to examine the action of P4 and six clinically relevant synthetic progestins (3-ketodesogestrel, drospirenone, levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone acetate, and trimegestone) on the progesterone receptor (PR)-positive T47Dco and the PR-negative T47D-Y breast cancer cell lines. Excluding drospirenone, one or more of the progestins-regulated 329 genes, with 30 genes regulated by at least 2.0-fold by all progestins in the T47Dco cells. The synthetic progestins show a high degree of similarity in their transcriptional responses, and each progestin regulates between 77 and 91% of the genes regulated by P4. Independent quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed a similar regulation for S100P, PPL, IL20RA, NET1, ATP1A1, HIG2, and CXCL12 (SDF-1) by all seven progestins. Attempts to find differentially regulated genes by any progestin compared to all other treatments failed, suggesting any differences are quantitative, not qualitative. This analysis demonstrates a high degree of similarity among these progestins on PR-regulated gene expression in T47D cells, suggesting a similar and fairly specific mode of action.

19595	16420	 5712	progesterone	Compound	BCL6	mRNA	0	1	16157482	Progesterone (P4) is an essential reproductive steroid hormone required for many aspects of female reproductive physiology. Progestins are compounds that demonstrate progesterone-like activity and are used in oral contraception, hormone therapy, and treatment of some reproductive disorders, but differ widely in their chemical structures, potency, and pharmacokinetics. While numerous studies have assessed progestins on specific endpoints, little is known about the activation of global gene expression by progestins. We used Affymetrix GeneChip U133A expression arrays to examine the action of P4 and six clinically relevant synthetic progestins (3-ketodesogestrel, drospirenone, levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone acetate, and trimegestone) on the progesterone receptor (PR)-positive T47Dco and the PR-negative T47D-Y breast cancer cell lines. Excluding drospirenone, one or more of the progestins-regulated 329 genes, with 30 genes regulated by at least 2.0-fold by all progestins in the T47Dco cells. The synthetic progestins show a high degree of similarity in their transcriptional responses, and each progestin regulates between 77 and 91% of the genes regulated by P4. Independent quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed a similar regulation for S100P, PPL, IL20RA, NET1, ATP1A1, HIG2, and CXCL12 (SDF-1) by all seven progestins. Attempts to find differentially regulated genes by any progestin compared to all other treatments failed, suggesting any differences are quantitative, not qualitative. This analysis demonstrates a high degree of similarity among these progestins on PR-regulated gene expression in T47D cells, suggesting a similar and fairly specific mode of action.

 9067	16420	 4970	progesterone	Compound	KLF4	mRNA	0	1	16157482	Progesterone (P4) is an essential reproductive steroid hormone required for many aspects of female reproductive physiology. Progestins are compounds that demonstrate progesterone-like activity and are used in oral contraception, hormone therapy, and treatment of some reproductive disorders, but differ widely in their chemical structures, potency, and pharmacokinetics. While numerous studies have assessed progestins on specific endpoints, little is known about the activation of global gene expression by progestins. We used Affymetrix GeneChip U133A expression arrays to examine the action of P4 and six clinically relevant synthetic progestins (3-ketodesogestrel, drospirenone, levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone acetate, and trimegestone) on the progesterone receptor (PR)-positive T47Dco and the PR-negative T47D-Y breast cancer cell lines. Excluding drospirenone, one or more of the progestins-regulated 329 genes, with 30 genes regulated by at least 2.0-fold by all progestins in the T47Dco cells. The synthetic progestins show a high degree of similarity in their transcriptional responses, and each progestin regulates between 77 and 91% of the genes regulated by P4. Independent quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed a similar regulation for S100P, PPL, IL20RA, NET1, ATP1A1, HIG2, and CXCL12 (SDF-1) by all seven progestins. Attempts to find differentially regulated genes by any progestin compared to all other treatments failed, suggesting any differences are quantitative, not qualitative. This analysis demonstrates a high degree of similarity among these progestins on PR-regulated gene expression in T47D cells, suggesting a similar and fairly specific mode of action.

14444	 8464	13598	Calcium	Compound	CD14	mRNA	0	1	11034352	Because LPS stimulation upregulates CD14 and TLR4 expression, it was necessary to control for the possibility that these newly expressed molecules were associated with one another independent of LPS stimulation. Although the calcium ionophore A23187 increased the expression of CD14 and TLR4, they did not exhibit energy transfer. However, following A23187 treatment, LPS promoted physical proximity between CD14 and TLR4. Therefore, we suggest that a close interaction between CD14 and TLR4 participates in LPS signaling, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.

Treatment of this spontaneous melanoma with the Akt inhibitor resulted in significant decreases in 3 genes that may account for this resistance. Sirt1 is a deacetylase that attenuates p53 in the presence of oxidative stress; rictor is a rapamycin-insensitive member of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex; and VEGF is likely the major angiogenic factor in melanoma. Inhibition of Akt led to significant and reproducible decreases in the mRNA levels of all 3 genes.  .... Note: if they didnt not use an inhibitor to verify AKT action, I coded to expression of AKT.

During the glucose clamp studies, we also measured circulating FFA levels (Fig. 5b) and HGP (Fig. 5c); because the effects of both TZDs were the same in the MKO animals (Fig. 5b), the data were combined. Basal FFA levels were elevated and poorly suppressed by insulin in the untreated MKO animals, whereas TZD administration decreased basal FFA levels below control values and enhanced the suppressive effects of insulin. In the untreated MKO animals, HGP was slightly elevated in the basal state, and the suppressive effects of insulin were significantly (P = 0.019) attenuated (Fig. 5c). After TZD treatment, basal HGP was decreased and the suppressive effects of insulin were restored (P = 0.006). TZDs also led to an increase of 2.9-fold (P = 0.0001) in intrahepatic triglyceride content, consistent with findings in other TZD-treated mouse models of insulin resistance38. Thus, TZDs exert their expected effects in adipose tissue and liver, but not muscle, in MKO animals.  Plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride and FFA levels were all decreased in vivo in the TZD-treated animals (Table 1). Thus, despite the fact that TZD treatment did not improve insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle, most of the other symptoms of Syndrome X were ameliorated, highlighting the importance of adipose tissue and liver as target organs for TZDs.  Protein and gene expression measurements Using quantitative PCR to measure mRNA expression of selected genes in skeletal muscle, we found that PPAR-alpha mRNA and AMPK protein levels were unchanged in MKO animals compared with controls, and were unaffected by TZD treatment (data not shown). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) and uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) mRNA levels were also comparable in MKO mice compared with controls (data not shown), but TZD administration caused a significant 85% decrease in UCP-3 and a 60% decrease in PDK-4 mRNA in all groups (P = 0.0003 and 0.02, respectively).

 1302	 3356	 7836	atorvastatin	Compound	CD55	mRNA	-1	1	NA	Background Complement-mediated vascular injury is important in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. As recent evidence shows that the statins, HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, have beneficial effects on endothelial cell (EC) function independent of lipid-lowering, we explored the hypothesis that statins modulate vascular EC resistance to complement through upregulation of complement-inhibitory proteins. Methods/Results Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin and expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP) and CD59 was measured by flow-cytometry. A dose-dependent increase in DAF expression of upto 4 fold was seen 24-48h post-treatment. CD59 expression was increased by 50% whilst MCP was unchanged. Similar results were obtained with human aortic EC. Statin-induced upregulation of DAF required increased steady-state mRNA and de novo protein synthesis. Inclusion of L-mevalonate, or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, reversed the effect on DAF expression, confirming the role of HMGCoA reductase inhibition and suggesting that DAF expression is negatively regulated by geranylgeranylation. Neither farnesyl pyrophosphate nor squalene inhibited statin-induced DAF expression suggesting the effect is independent of cholesterol lowering. We found that statin-induced DAF expression is mediated by activation of PKC? and inhibition of RhoA and is independent of PI-3K and nitric oxide activity. The increase of DAF following statin treatment is functionally relevant, resulting in marked reduction in C3 deposition and complement-mediated EC lysis inhibitable by anti-DAF mAb 1H4 (p < 0.05). Conclusions These observations provide evidence for a novel cytoprotective action of the statins on vascular endothelium, independent of the effect on lipids, and resulting in enhanced protection against complement-mediated injury. Modulation of complement regulatory protein expression by statins may contribute to the early beneficial effects of statins in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis.

10029	15405	 7330	Dietary Lipid	Compound	Csf2rb2	mRNA	-1	1	16129712	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of a high-fat diet on gene expression in adipose tissues and to determine induction kinetics of adipose monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and -3 (MCP-1 and MCP-3) in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and the effect of a lack of MCP-1 signaling on DIO susceptibility and macrophage recruitment into adipose tissue. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Obese and lean adipose tissues were profiled for expression changes. The time-course of MCP-1 and MCP-3 expression was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Plasma MCP-1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) knockout mice were placed on the high-fat diet to determine DIO susceptibility. Macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry with F4/80 antibody. RESULTS: DIO elevated adipose expression of many inflammatory genes, including MCP-1 and MCP-3. Adipose MCP-1 and MCP-3 mRNA levels increased within 7 days of starting a high-fat diet, with elevation of plasma MCP-1 detected after 4 weeks on the diet. The induction of MCP-1 and MCP-3 expression preceded that of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The elevated plasma MCP-1 concentration in obese mice was partially reversed by treatment with AM251. No change in DIO susceptibility and macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue were observed in CCR2 knockout mice, which lack the MCP-1 receptor CCR2. DISCUSSION: A high-fat diet elevated adipose expression of inflammatory genes, including early induction of MCP-1 and MCP-3, supporting the view that obese adipose tissues contribute to systemic inflammation. However, despite increased MCP-1 in obesity, disruption of MCP-1 signaling did not confer resistance to DIO in mice or reduce adipose tissue macrophage infiltration.

Activation of the CREB transcriptional factor by forskolin dramatically promoted the expression of PEN-2 mRNA and protein, whereas the other components of the gamma-secretase complex remained unaffected. Forskolin treatment slightly increases the secretion of soluble APPalpha and Abeta without affecting Notch cleavage. These results demonstrate that expression of PEN-2 is regulated by CREB and suggest that the specific control of PEN-2 expression may imply additional physiological functions uniquely assigned to PEN-2

Lipid usage is stimulated during fasting, diabetes mellitus and exercise, concomitant with enhanced LPL expression in skeletal muscle. Here we show that the forkhead type transcription factor FKHR is strongly induced in skeletal muscle in fasting mice, in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and in mice after treadmill running. Ectopic expression of FKHR enhanced LPL gene expression in C2C12 muscle cells in culture. These results implicate FKHR as an important modulator of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle.

To provide insight into the role of PTEN mutations in prostate cancer, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells. These studies revealed that adenoviral overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line resulted in apoptosis and induced the expression of many genes that affect cellular proliferation or survival. The expression of one of these FOXO-regulated genes, TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor family, was decreased in human metastatic prostate tumors. The altered expression of TRAIL in these tumors correlated directly with decreased PTEN expression and the resultant loss of FKHRL1 and FKHR activity. Analysis of the effects of FOXO proteins on the TRAIL promoter localized the FKHRL1 responsive element of the TRAIL promoter to nucleotides -138 to -121 and demonstrated that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1. These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells.

36610	 9377	 1407	FOXO1	Protein	DUSP4	mRNA	0	1	12351634	Mutations in PTEN occur in 60-80% of prostate cancers and lead to a constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and a resultant loss of activity of the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1 and FKHR. To provide insight into the role of PTEN mutations in prostate cancer, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells. These studies revealed that adenoviral overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line resulted in apoptosis and induced the expression of many genes that affect cellular proliferation or survival. The expression of one of these FOXO-regulated genes, TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor family, was decreased in human metastatic prostate tumors. The altered expression of TRAIL in these tumors correlated directly with decreased PTEN expression and the resultant loss of FKHRL1 and FKHR activity. Analysis of the effects of FOXO proteins on the TRAIL promoter localized the FKHRL1 responsive element of the TRAIL promoter to nucleotides -138 to -121 and demonstrated that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1. These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells.

In liver-derived cells, FOXO proteins stimulate the activity of promoters for IGFBP-1, glucose-6 phosphatase, and PEPCK. In other cell types, FOXO proteins also stimulate the expression of proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression, including p27Kip, Rb2, and GADD45, and proteins that promote cells death, including Bim and Fas ligand.

61883	 9377	 9387	FOXO1	Protein	DAPK1	mRNA	0	1	12351634	Mutations in PTEN occur in 60-80% of prostate cancers and lead to a constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and a resultant loss of activity of the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1 and FKHR. To provide insight into the role of PTEN mutations in prostate cancer, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells. These studies revealed that adenoviral overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line resulted in apoptosis and induced the expression of many genes that affect cellular proliferation or survival. The expression of one of these FOXO-regulated genes, TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor family, was decreased in human metastatic prostate tumors. The altered expression of TRAIL in these tumors correlated directly with decreased PTEN expression and the resultant loss of FKHRL1 and FKHR activity. Analysis of the effects of FOXO proteins on the TRAIL promoter localized the FKHRL1 responsive element of the TRAIL promoter to nucleotides -138 to -121 and demonstrated that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1. These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells.
